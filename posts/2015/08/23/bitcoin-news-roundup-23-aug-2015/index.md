In his speech in the 2<sup>nd</sup>2nd Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financial Terrorism Stakeholders Consultative Workshop that took place in Abuja, Akpan stated:<em>“T</em><em>he </em>virtual currency is dangerous because it is not a legal tender of any country hence it has a borderless nature without jurisdiction which makes it a channel for money laundering<em>.</em><em>”</em></p>
    <p>Businesses using blockchain technology to facilitate the transfer of precious metals are viewed as money transmitters.

FinCEN claims that each company that does that is both a money transmitter and a precious metals dealer, and therefore, subject to the relevant regulations, which include assessment of money laundering risk and implementation of anti-money laundering program (AML), above all.</p>
