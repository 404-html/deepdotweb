    <p><a href="http://www.cbs58.com/story/30665044/credit-card-cloning-scheme-busted">The United States Secret Service arrested two men, Bradley Beauge and James Pierre, in the Red Roof Inn Hotel in Oak Creek.</a> The two men were charged with the crime of credit card cloning.</p>
    <p>According to law enforcement authorities, the carders printed their own names on the credit cards, however, the cards were linked back to the victims’ bank accounts. The local police found out of the scheme when they had a complaint from the Red Roof Inn Hotel. After they responded to the request, they found &#8220;numerous cards&#8221; with the same name, and then found a &#8220;credit card cloning device.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Paul Hager, a spokesman for Information Technology Professionals made this statement:</p>
    <p>&#8220;Cloners or carders go about purchasing card numbers they usually do this on the dark web or the deep web.&#8221;</p>
    <p>He also explained that many criminals (carders) use the &#8220;dark web&#8221; to buy credit information in bundles and bulk.</p>
    <p>&#8220;This is a separate internet or from the internet that most people are browsing,&#8221; he also said.</p>
    <p>According to the police, the two arrested carders were using a “card making machine” for cloning the credit cards. They put the credit card information that they bought from dark net markets and put their own names to the front. The card writer is sold for about $150 legally (you can even buy one at Ebay). Many firms use credit writers to encode gift card amounts onto the magnetic strip on the back of the card. However, in the current case, the carders did not use the card writer for legal case, they used it for putting stolen credit card information on the magnetic strips. Hager also made these statements:</p>
    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same reader you use when you make a purchase they can write that data onto a magnetic strip.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;It says the person&#8217;s name on the front so what actually goes into the system is the name and information out of a valid credit card held by someone else.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Hager says that most carders get found by the police when they order stuff to a specific address. In the current case, the two credit card cloners bought iPads and kept them stored at the Ted Roof Inn Hotel.</p>
    <p>&#8220;That purchase has a history that purchase history has a tracking number, the tracking number is linked to an address and that address can ultimately be tracked back.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Bradley Beauge and James Pierre were tracked, booked and charged for identity theft by the law enforcement authorities.</p>
    <p>An expert in the case states that the new credit card chip will help stop credit cloning schemes since it doesn&#8217;t just replicate data, it links directly to the credit company.</p>
