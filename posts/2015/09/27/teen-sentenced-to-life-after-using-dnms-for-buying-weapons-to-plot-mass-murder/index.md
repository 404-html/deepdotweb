    <p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/liam-lyburd-sentenced">Liam Lyburd, a British teenager living in his family house at Hamilton Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, has been sentenced for life for planning a massacre at his former Newcastle College.</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/07/27/teenager-used-dnms-for-buying-weapons-and-ammo-to-plot-mass-murder-at-his-former-college/">We have already written an article</a> about Lyburd when he was caught by the police, however, his trial just ended and have resulted in a life sentence for the 19-year-old teenager.</p>
    <p>Both the police and the judge had a relatively easy job since Lyburd has left evidence of his plot everywhere. Firstly, he has made a Facebook post about his intent on carrying out the mass murder under the name of Felix Burns. Secondly, the police has found the teen’s stash in his parents’ house, which included a Glock gun, 94 jacketed hollow point expanding bullets, tear gas and several homemade explosive devices, including pipe bombs that he made himself. Thirdly, and most importantly, Lyburd has made statements to the prosecutors, right after he was caught by LE, that proved his intentions. Prosecutor Nick Dry has made a statement about this:</p>
    <p>“He then stated that he had intended to carry out a mass murder at Newcastle College that very day and that the officers had saved lives, preventing what would have otherwise been a massacre at the college.</p>
    <p>“He repeated to them that it had been his intention to blow up the college and, as he put it, ‘to shoot a bunch of people’, laughing as he was transported to the police station and speculating that he would get four years for it.”</p>
    <p>Also, he has admitted nine charges of the total 17, including the making and the buying of the weapons that the law enforcement authorities have found at his parents’ house. According to LE, Lyburd has bought all his DNM stuff from the Evolution market. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/18/evolution-marketplace-exit-scam-biggest-exist-scam-ever/">Evo has been already shut down during the infamous exit scam of the website.</a> The teen also bought his Glock gun from Evo, which he has stated on the court buying the gun was as easy as “buying a bar of chocolate”.</p>
    <p>During the trial, Judge Paul Sloan QC told the accused: “I am satisfied there is a significant risk to the public of serious harm by you.” He also described the evidence against Lyburd as “chilling to say the least”.</p>
    <p>The sentence was delayed until the end of Lyburd’s psychiatric report, however, the report has stated that Lyburd isn’t suffering from “acute mental illness” and has never been. The only mental problem the report has shown that Lyburd is suffering from a personality disorder. However, this disorder is not enough to justify the planning of a massacre. Judge Paul Sloan has also told the same to the teen: “Your personality disorders have no way impaired your ability to know what you were doing.”</p>
    <p>The life sentence that was given by the judge to Lyburd is not a “full life sentence” (meaning he can’t get out of jail for his entire lifetime), according to the sentence, Lyburd must serve at least eight years in prison before any release can be considered.</p>
    <p>The leader of the Northumbria police’s investigation, Detective Superintendent George Duff has said outside court that Lyburd is a dangerous man. His full statement goes by:</p>
    <p>“Lyburd is a dangerous man who intended to cause serious harm,” he said. “He at no point has shown any remorse for what he intended to do. By not admitting his wrongdoing in the first instance shows the utter lack of consideration for those he intended to harm.</p>
    <p>“Thankfully the courts and the jury came to the best decision and today Lyburd is behind bars where he belongs.</p>
    <p>“His actions not only caused threats to certain people but it also caused concern and disruption to the local community and I would like to thank them for their cooperation throughout the investigation. Community vigilance plays an important role in policing our communities and we encourage anyone with concerns to contact police straight away.”</p>
