    <p>As it was published in <a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/silk-road-20-drug-dealer-9507820">walesonline</a>:</p>
    <blockquote><p>A drug dealer caught as part of an international clampdown on the so-called “dark net” platform Silk Road 2.0 has been warned he could face jail.</p>
    <p>Cei William Owens, was arrested with six other Britons last year by the National Crime Agency (NCA), hours after the FBI swooped on the controversial website’s alleged creator.</p>
    <p>Owens, from Aberystwyth, appeared at Swansea Crown Court on Monday where he pleaded guilty to five charges.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old admitted supplying or offering to supply class A and B drugs &#8211; magic mushrooms and cannabis &#8211; as well as three counts of possession.</p></blockquote>
    <p>&#8230;</p>
    <blockquote><p>Despite his early guilty plea, Judge Keith Thomas warned the defendant that “all options remained open” when it came to sentencing.</p>
    <p>Judge Thomas also granted a proceeds of crime application made by prosecution counsel Claire Wilks.</p>
    <p>It gives police powers to seize any money or assets Owens made during his operation.</p>
    <p>Owens, formerly of Aberdovey, was granted bail subject to several conditions.</p>
    <p>He will be sentenced on July 24 ahead of a proceeds of crime hearing later in the year.</p></blockquote>
