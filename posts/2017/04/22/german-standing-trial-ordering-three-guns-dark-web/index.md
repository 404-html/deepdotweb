    <p>A man from Neuburg-Schrobenhausen, Germany is <a href="http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/aichach/Waffendeal-auf-Supermarkt-Parkplatz-25-Jaehriger-vor-Gericht-id41097951.html">standing trial</a> for attempted purchase of three Glock guns from the dark web, along with growing and possessing large amounts of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/02/11/teenager-spends-18k-marijuana-darknet-markets-gets-sentenced-community-service/">marijuana</a>.</p>

    <p>“On a late summer afternoon last year. A man is sitting in a supermarket cafe. He&#8217;s waiting. A little later a young guy appears. He raises his hand briefly, reveals himself. The two talk, then they go to a car in the parking lot. The luggage compartment is opened. The older of the two takes something from a bag. The young man checks the item and then takes three bundles of money from his pocket. It is 10,400 euros,” an author of the German news outlet augsburger-allgemeine.de described the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/03/29/weapon-vendor-sold-gun-munich-shooter-formally-charged/">weapons</a> deal the 25-year-old suspect allegedly conducted.</p>
    <p>According to police information, the 25-year-old suspect from Neuburg-Schrobenhausen intended to purchase three Glock 17 <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/gun/">handguns</a>, three silencers and 3000 rounds of 9mm ammunition for 10,400 euros. The defendant allegedly tried to conduct the arms deal in a supermarket parking lot, however, SEK (Special Mission Command – a special unit of the German police) intervened and arrested the 25-year-old man, who showed no resistance when authorities tied him on the ground.</p>
    <p>On this week, the 25-year-old was charged with the deliberate acquisition of three semi-automatic short weapons and possession of narcotics before the Ingolstadt Regional Court. The public prosecutor&#8217;s office in Ingolstadt charged him for illicit attempts to purchase the pistols, including ammunition, and drug possession.</p>
    <p>When investigators of the Federal Criminal Police (BKA) searched the home of the 25-year-old, they found at least 30 cannabis plants. The plants’ most beautiful specimens have reached a height of three meters. According to the court information, a part of the plants was already harvested. Police seized over seven kilograms of marijuana. In one room, law enforcement authorities found three combat knives, a machete, a gas pistol, and various soft-air weapons.</p>
    <p>When the prosecutor read the complaint, the defendant fully and immediately confessed. He had already made a &#8220;deeply frightened&#8221; impression during the arrest, according to one of the officers. The 25-year-old’s hearing was held at the First Criminal Court under the chairmanship of the President of the District Court, Jochen Bösl, very intimidated. The suspect was defended by Michael Adams from Münich. The lawyer nodded at his client, who began to tell his own story about the case.</p>
    <p>“How can I protect myself and my family?” the defendant asked the court. He said that he constantly was in fear since strangers had tried twice to break in with them at home, the dog of the family had been killed by a stranger with rat poison. Additionally, the 25-year-old and his mother feared potential terrorist attacks in Bavaria. Since the defendant was skinny, he chose to defend himself with a handgun, he told the court.</p>
    <p>According to the 25-year-old’s confession, he had researched, downloaded an app (the Tor Browser most possibly) that allowed him to access the dark web, where he ordered the weapons, silencers, and ammunition. The defendant needed the guns to reduce his fear, and the silencers if more terrorists would attack him. So if he were to shoot, the attackers would not be able to hear his shots immediately. Police information stated that the accused does not have any experience in the handling of firearms.</p>
    <p>However, what the defendant did not know when he ordered the illicit goods that the Australian Federal Police was already investigating his case. Australian authorities immediately informed the Wiesbaden BKA.</p>
    <p>&#8220;From today&#8217;s point of view, all this was a bad mistake. I&#8217;ve been in there again,” the accused admitted during his court trial.</p>
    <p>When he was asked about the marijuana, the defendant claimed that he intended to give the drug to his father who was ill. In a documentary, he had seen that with marijuana the suffering of the disease his father had could be alleviated. In Salzburg, he had taken purchase seeds and started growing them. He wanted to roll joints for his father or make some kind of butter.</p>
    <p>The mother, who was asked questions by the defense counsel, confirmed her son&#8217;s statement on both the terrorist and the sick father. Further proceedings in the case will be expected soon.</p>
