    <p>In late 2016, a 24-year-old man from Bad Ischl in Upper Austria caught the investigative eye of Customs officials at the Frankfurt airport.Police simply intercepted, by chance, a package of amphetamine headed directly for the man, bearing his name. Authorities from Customs in Frankfurt sent word of the package seizure to law enforcement in Austria and an arrest occurred shortly after a house search.</p>
    <p>Customs proceeded with the investigation—or at least their end of the investigation—and tested the amphetamine. They knew the amphetamine that <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/arrested/">Customs intercepted</a> weighed more than an amount for personal use. The amphetamine package weighed in at 250 kilograms and, according to chemical tests, was of a high level of purity. (Note: several sources reported 75-gram seizures not the initial ”quarter-kilogram” number. Another source claimed Customs caught a <a href="http://www.salzkammergut-rundblick.at/000007__news__37304.htm">280 kilogram package instead of 250</a>.)</p>
    <p>During that same September, police in Austria investigated the 24-year-old. After nearly half-a-year of investigations and bureaucratic loose ends, <a href="http://ooe.orf.at/news/stories/2834710/">police announced a court date</a> for the alleged trafficker. Alleged in a purely technical sense; the young man all but willingly provided law enforcement with evidence of everything. Local news outlets explained that the defendant was &#8220;doomed&#8221; without a thought otherwise. Details surrounding his status as a vendor remain unclear, though.</p>

    <p>According to police records, once Austrian authorities discovered the man&#8217;s activities, they raided his house. The Wels public prosecutor issued an arrest warrant with haste. In the defendant&#8217;s house and surrounding property, the police found drugs, a gun, shipping supplies, and money. &#8220;The house search resulted in the discovery of amphetamines, cocaine, and a cannabis breed [grow] operation,” Jürgen Pachner from the Krone said. “During the house search in Bad Ischl, investigators also found a 3,000 Euros, a taser, and a &#8216;gas pistol,&#8221;&#8217;</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.kronehit.at/news/ooe-drogen-im-darknet-bestellt/">The 24-year-old confessed</a>, on the scene, to his crimes in majority. That he sold drugs, that the drugs, money, and illegal weaponry belonged to him, and so on. Authorities arrested him and brought him to the police department for questioning and the inherent incarceration. The suspect then admitted that he purchased packages on the darknet and resold them. News outlets reported that he used the drugs to feed his own addiction and that he sold them again – on the darknet. So far, only reports of real life transactions have surfaced. His upcoming hearing will reveal the rest.</p>
    <p>According to the police and what the suspect told the police, he ordered from (or simply “used”) the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/drug/">darknet marketplaces</a> for one-and-a-half years before the arrest. The suspect—according to other suspects, in other drug cases—sold kilograms of marijuana and worthwhile quantities of other drugs as well. However, they too kept any potential darknet activity under wraps. His trial in Linz, unless he falls into another Investigation, should reveal everything currently unknown to the general public.</p>
