    <p>Nearly half a year after the<a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/17/dark-web-vendor-chemical-love-busted-50-kg-drugs-seized/"> arrests of the individuals behind the “Chemical Love”</a> marketplace, charges have been formally filed. On April, 2016, German police raided the basement of what was considered the Chemical Love headquarters. Massive quantities of drugs were seized. Police announced the arrest of five individuals as a result of the raid.</p>

    <p>In early October, the prosecutor&#8217;s office announced charges against <strong>six </strong>individuals involved in running Chemical Love.<a href="http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.affaere-um-walter-kelsch-bundesweiter-drogenring-ausgehoben.99efc357-376c-4f27-a9e1-2babeda92da9.html"> Police announced the indictment and arrest</a> of <strong>five </strong>individuals after the raid in April. The five suspects were between the ages of 21 and 61 and, as far as we know, have been incarcerated since the arrest.</p>
    <p>The Central Cybercrime Office (LZC) of the General Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office <a href="http://www2.mjv.rlp.de/icc/justiz/nav/a0b/broker.jsp?uMen=a0bc3768-b0b2-11d4-a737-0050045687ab&amp;uCon=4f33243f-5e1b-7518-4119-d462e4e2711c&amp;uTem=aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-000000000042">announced the charges</a> on October 11, 2016. Notably, they announced that six individuals had been charged, not the originally announced five.</p>
    <p>Walter Kelsch, former national football player, is 61-years-old as of this article. <a href="http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.ermittlungen-gegen-walter-kelsch-ex-nationalspieler-in-schwierigkeiten.2be04ca8-b14a-40db-b829-b1e77bbb5021.html">Kelsch’s arrest in connection with Chemical Love</a> was well publicized following the press release. Given that the LZC press release mentions only one 61-year-old, one can safely assume Kelsch is the relevant suspect.</p>
    <p>Kelsch was under investigation for investment fraud from as early as 2013.</p>
    <p>The first charges announced were those associated with two 30-year-olds. Both have been charged with the importation of 90kg of amphetamine and 3kg of marijuana from the Netherlands. The two 30-year-olds then met up with a 29-year-old towards the end of 2015.</p>
    <p>Additionally, both 30-year-olds and the 29-year-old were charged with the importation of 60kg of amphetamine between December 2015 and March 2016.</p>
    <p>When the three were arrested and the “narcotics depot” was raided, police found the following:</p>
    <p>approximately 45 kilograms of amphetamine from the Netherlands, more than 3.5 kilograms of amphetamine, 1.4 kilograms of cocaine, 230 grams of heroin, 4158 LSD trips, 2 kilograms of hashish, 250 grams of crystal meth, 4.7 kilograms of MDMA in crystalline form, and 5.1 kilograms of ecstasy pills. In addition, they are expected to receive approximately 75 kilograms of amphetamine, 3.6 kilograms of MDMA, 2,700 LSD trips, 12,800 ecstasy pills, 1,67 kilograms of cocaine, 300 grams of heroin, 2.93 kilograms of hashish and 2,300 kilos of amphetamine 165 grams of crystal meth.</p>
    <p>On one of the three aforementioned individuals’ trips, a 35-year-old played a role in the operation. He has been charged for the transport of 45kg of amphetamine. He was notably only under investigation shortly before the major bust occurred.</p>

    <p>The 23-year-old man and the 61-year-old Kelsch are charged with providing aid for illicit trafficking and illicit importation narcotics in not a small quantity.</p>
    <p>According to the press release:</p>
    <p>Two of the accused have essentially admittedly admitted, two other accused have not given any information on the accusations against them. The two suspects, who are accused of the &#8220;chaffeurienste [chauffeur services]&#8221;, make regular trips to the Netherlands. They deny, however, the knowledge of the criminal purposes of these journeys.</p>
    <p>Three others were initially suspected of involvement but they have been dismissed upon lack of evidence. An additional case emerged from the the initial Chemical Love discovery. A 48-year-old had his trial separated on account of the charges being related to money laundering.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the first three men have been charged with serious drug importation. The second three played only a minor role or aided in only a single instance. All charges announced varied from drug importation, trafficking, conspiracy, and aiding all of the above.</p>
