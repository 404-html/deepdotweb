    <p>Following a deepweb crack-down promised by law enforcement in Germany, another suspected deepweb vendor has been arrested. While little information is known, the current details indicate the arrestees ran a large scale global operation.</p>
    <p>In July, the Federal Police in Germany announced that investigating the deepweb has become a priority for federal law enforcement. This newfound focus came directly from the results of the Munich gunman investigation. The weapon he used came from a darknet marketplace, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/24/munich-gunman-got-weapon-darknet/">the Bavarian Office of Criminal Investigation revealed</a>.</p>

    <p>“We see that the dark net is a growing trading place and therefore we need to prioritize our investigations here,” said Holger Muench, head of Germany’s Federal Police. Not more than a month later, the deepweb firearm <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/25/german-dnm-vendor-arrested-selling-glock-munich-shooter/">vendor was arrested</a> for his role in the Munich shooting. Many deepweb related arrests have been made following Muench’s announcement, including the famed vendor shop “<a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/12/nationwide-raid-vendor-chemical-loves-customers-germany/">Chemical Love.</a>”</p>
    <p>In early September, patrol officers in Neuenhaus became aware of a vehicle occupied by two men. The officers on patrol found the vehicle at 11:15pm. After marking the vehicle suspicious, general traffic control officers conducted a search of the vehicle. The suspects, a 53-year-old and a 56-year-old, had a “considerable” amount of drugs in the car, <a href="http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/104234/3438262">the report explains</a>.</p>
    <p>Inside the vehicle, 37 letters were discovered. The pre-addressed letters contained various quantities of different types of drugs. Law enforcement found 2 kilograms of amphetamine, 5275 ecstasy pills, roughly 815 grams of cocaine, and 135 LSD strips. According to the report, the total sale value of the drugs is estimated to be $112,265. With the addresses already on the letters, investigators were able to determine the scope of the operation.</p>
    <p>The two men primarily shipped within Germany but also had several international packages.</p>
    <p>Between early September and the press release in late October, both men were seen by a judge. No further details have been released to the public. Similarly, no major German deepweb vendor has disappeared.</p>
