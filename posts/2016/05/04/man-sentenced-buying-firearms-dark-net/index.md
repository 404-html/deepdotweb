    <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/hyannis-man-sentenced-purchasing-firearm-and-silencer-darknet-using-bitcoin">Justin Moreira,22, was sentenced</a> by Federal Court Judge F. Dennis Saylor, to 42 months in prison and three years of supervised release. In November 2015, Moreira plead guilty to three counts of being a felon in possession of ammunition and firearms. Moreira had a conviction in 2013 for possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute; which is a felony.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=Moreira">Beginning</a><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=Moreira"> in January 2015</a>, Moreira engaged a federal undercover agent in a series of online messages during which Moreira inquired about the potential purchase of several different firearms. Ultimately, Moreira ordered a Walther PPK/S .380 caliber pistol and silencer from the agent for $2,500 worth of bitcoin. Moreira instructed the agent to ship the package to a post office box in Hyannis. Federal agents monitoring the post office box immediately arrested Moreira after he retrieved the package.</p>
    <p>United States Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz, Daniel J. Kumor, Special Agent in Charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, Boston Field Division Shelly Binkowski, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal inspection Service Matthew Etre, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Boston Colonel Richard D. McKeon, Superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, and Barnstable Police Chief Paul MacDonald, made the announcement today. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary B. Murane of Ortiz&#8217;s Criminal Division.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the Agora guns and weapons seller “weaponsguy” began receiving complaints of packages not arriving and being a scammer. In November 2014 he returned from vacation, got the complaining buy to vouch for him, and resumed selling guns and related items. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/04/07/is-vendor-weaponsguy-on-agora-atffbi/">Weaponsguy was identified as an ATF controlled account</a> which did undercover sales to Moreira in March-April of 2015. In which case it seems likely that weaponsguy followed the same life cycle as Dark_Mart and other FBI controlled accounts on Evolution and was busted sometime around or after the complaints began, cooperated and his account bean to be operated by ATF.</p>
