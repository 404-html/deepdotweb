    <p>Michael Mancini (20), an East Stroudsburg University (ESU) student from Landenberg, Chester County, was <a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/local/police/mc-n-east-stroudsburg-dark-web-lsd-20160505-story.html">busted by the police for ordering LSD</a> from a dark net market. The college student was charged with the possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, criminal use of a communication facility and other related offenses. Mancini was arrested on Wednesday, and soon released on an unsecured bail later on that day.</p>
    <p>According to the Monroe County district attorneyâ€™s office, the university police received a complaint of Mancini ordering LSD from the dark web and selling it to his fellow students. Law enforcement authorities were informed by a resident director for Lenape Hall at the college who had noticed on Tuesday that Mancini had received a letter from Hawaii. The director contacted police and soon after that, the authorities came with a search warrant.</p>
    <p>Investigators found a sealed plastic bag in the envelope from Hawaii labeled &#8220;Mint Condition&#8221; with two game cards with a small piece of paper between them, which tested positive as LSD. Police seized a computer, a cellphone, cash, a glass device for smoking marijuana, a plastic bag and flavored cigars from the student.</p>
    <p>According to police, Mancini said he ordered 10 hits of LSD, took two for himself and sold the eight others. The second time he ordered 25 hits and made arrangements to meet with some people to sell the drugs. Police added that Mancini admitted ordering LSD twice from the dark web.</p>
