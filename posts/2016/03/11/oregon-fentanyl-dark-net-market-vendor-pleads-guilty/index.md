    <p><a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/3981314-oregon-man-pleads-guilty-integral-role-grand-forks-fentanyl-deaths">Brandon Corde Hubbard (41), an Oregon man, pleaded guilty to the charges of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances resulting in serious bodily injury and death, distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death and money laundering.</a> The fentanyl that Hubbard was selling caused two overdose deaths in Grand Forks.</p>
    <p>Hubbard signed the plea agreement on Dec 21, 2015, where he admitted that he sold the opioid substance that resulted in the deaths of Bailey Henke (18) and Evan Poitra (19) and other overdoses causing serious injuries to the victims. The two counts that the man had been charged with could result in two life sentences, however, prosecutors recommend a lesser sentence since of the plea agreement. According to Judge Ralph Erickson, the minimum time served for Hubbard is 20 years in prison though, unless prosecution asks for a lesser sentence.</p>
    <p>According to US Attorney Chris Myers, Hubbard seeks to offer restitution, which would cover the funeral and the medical bills of the victims.</p>
    <p>During his vendor career, the Oregon man imported $1.5 million worth of fentanyl from China and Canada and resold the substance to buyers in the US. He used dark net markets to sell and the US postal service to distribute his products.</p>
    <p>Hubbard was arrested as a part of Operation Denial, a joint action between members of the Grand Forks County narcotics task force, Grand Forks Police Department, State&#8217;s Attorney David Jones, Grand Forks Sheriff&#8217;s Office and UND Police Department. During the operation, nine were charged in North Dakota and three in Oregon. One of them was Ryan Jon Jensen (20), who resold the drugs that he purchased from Hubbard. The man was sentenced to 20 years of prison time.</p>
    <p>Operation Denial resulted in four other federal sentencing too: Joshua Tyler Fulp (20) who received 12 years; Kain Daniel Schwandt (19), 3½ years; David Todd Noye Jr. (18), 3¼ years; and Jameson Robert Sele (20), three years.</p>
