    <p>Beau Wattigney (30), (AKA. PurpleLotus, GoldenLotus, CouponKing) a New Orleans man, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-orleans-man-sentenced-41-months-manufacturing-and-selling-more-1-million-counterfeit">has been sentenced to 41 months for manufacturing and selling more than $1 million in counterfeit coupons</a> on Silk Road. Wattigney previously pleaded guilty to the charge of “conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit trademark counterfeiting”. After the plea, Judge Lemelle sentenced the man and immediately put him into custody.</p>
    <p>In addition to that, the counterfeiter admitted that in the time frame between May 2012 and November 2014, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/05/28/thepurplelotus-indicted-for-wire-fraud-trademark-counterfeiting-using-silk-road-12/">he sold counterfeit coupons for several products and services on Silk Road</a> under the pseudo names of PurpleLotus, GoldenLotus and CouponKing. Wattigney admitted the act of creating and manufacturing fraudulent coupons with the assistance of co-conspirators who designed the vouchers to look like original print-at-home manufacturers’ coupons by using the original companies’ trademarks on them. The plea agreement states that Wattigney sold over $1 million worth of counterfeit coupons and victimized more than 50 businesses residing in the United States.</p>
    <p>The case was investigated by the Philadelphia Division of the FBI, with the assistance from the FBI’s New Orleans Field Office. The prosecutors of the case were Senior Counsel Marie-Flore Johnson and Robert Wallace of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jordan Ginsberg of the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>
