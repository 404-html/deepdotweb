    <p>In an exclusively translated <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/02/01/how-scandinavias-biggest-vendor-created-his-empire-on-valhalla/">interview for </a><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/02/01/how-scandinavias-biggest-vendor-created-his-empire-on-valhalla/"><em>DeepDotWeb</em></a>, the world learned about the life of Scandinavia’s biggest darknet vendor, Douppikauppa.</p>
    <p>Douppikauppa had been selling on Valhalla since 2013 and is well known for being Scandinavia’s biggest darknet vendor. He was <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/customs_uncover_huge_online_drug_seller/9122125">arrested in Finland</a> with massive quantities of drugs in his possession.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15333 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image.jpeg 580w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
    <p>In the interview we learned so much about Douppikauppa and insight of the massive operations he ran. Douppikauppa stated his empire was created essentially from nothing but he quickly rose to infamy as a drug lord, stated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arman_Alizad">Arman Alizad</a>, an international TV celebrity.</p>
    <p>In the interview, Douppikauppa described some of his operations and intel, including how he balanced his real world life and that of his deepweb presence. He mentions a “close call” with a contact in the Netherlands, and according to another Finnish news source, a similar event contributed to the takedown of Douppikauppa’s operation.</p>
    <p>Excerpt from the interview on DeepDotWeb mentioning the Netherlands:</p>
    <p><strong>Arman: Has any of your employees been caught with dealing drugs?</strong></p>
    <p><em>DK: The closest call has been for one of our contacts in the Netherlands. And a couple of groups have been caught over the darknet because of dealing on the streets.</em></p>
    <p><em>Last April, a Finnish Customs unit intercepted a </em>vehicle that was <em>smuggling drugs between the Netherlands and Finland. The car contained</em> approximately one million doses of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy tablets, LSD-tabs, amphetamine and methamphetamine.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.savonsanomat.fi/kotimaa/Tulli-paljasti-Suomen-suurimman-huumeiden-nettikaupan/824717">According to Hannu Sinkkonen</a>, an official from the Finnish Customs Board, the suspect was a member of Douppikauppa’s general operations. The majority of these drugs Douppikauppa sold on the deepweb were brought into the country in a similar manner.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15334 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-1.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-1.jpeg 580w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-1-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
    <p>While the specifics of Douppikauppa’s arrest are still unclear, the connection between April’s arrest of the drug smuggler and the announcement from Finnish Customs on August 26<sup>th</sup> is not yet known. Somehow, a connection was made and an investigation into Douppikauppa’s deepweb activities started.</p>
    <p>&#8220;We followed everything that happened then, and also online, and in that way we uncovered this case today,&#8221; said Sinkkonen.</p>
    <p>While Douppikauppa is quite possibly most famous for his LSD and other psychedelics drug trades, the bust resulted in the finding of a plethora of other drugs including amphetamines, methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, alpha-pvp and MDVP.</p>
    <p>Finnish law enforcement estimates the value of the drugs seized to be somewhere over $2 million.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15335 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-2.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-2.jpeg 1140w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-2-300x187.jpeg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-2-1024x640.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
    <p>The bust is believed to have a significant impact on the Finnish drugs market as well, by either slowing or completely stopping the importation of drugs into Finland. Germany and Holland are two locations the customs official cited as Douppikauppa’s drug territories. By stopping this one deal future drug trafficking from this region can possibly be prevented. More than “10 million doses” were imported from both countries. This is a huge hit to the drug operation.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15336 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-3.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-3.jpeg 640w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-3-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
    <p>While we know Douppikauppa had been operating since 2013, Finnish law enforcement cites that the operation had only been online since 2014. Being a deepweb vendor on Valhalla, all transactions were done through Bitcoin, the customs official points out.</p>
    <p>&#8220;They have exceptional IT skills,&#8221; he said.</p>
    <p>The three suspects, while unnamed for now, are about 30-years-old and have completely clean criminal records when it comes to drug offenses.</p>
    <p>The case will likely be heard at the District Court in Southwest Finland sometime this fall.</p>
