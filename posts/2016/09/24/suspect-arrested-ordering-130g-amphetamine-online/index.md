    <p>In Croatia, the Dubrovnik-Neretva County Criminal Police Department began to suspect an individual for drug related crimes. According to the <a href="http://dubrovacki.hr/clanak/86051/kupovao-drogu-preko-interneta">department’s website</a>, an unidentified 31-year-old hit the police’s radar in early July. The man was suspected of illicit production of narcotics and of drug trafficking.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15538 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-26.jpeg"/> The General Police Directorate started investigating. Not long after, police discovered the target had purchased at least 130g of amphetamine off the internet. The packages had been delivered to an address in the Dubrovnik area. Through an undisclosed method, investigators were able to find out when following packages were to arrive.</p>
    <p>Police officers then prepared for the arrival of a package. When the drugs eventually were delivered, police waited at the address for the recipient to show up. On August 24, 2016, the suspect picked up the package and was immedietly arrested. He is currently being held in a detention center in Dubrovnik-Neretva County.</p>
    <p>Further details have not been made public.</p>
