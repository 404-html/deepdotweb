    <p>Yesterday a complaint against Dwayne C. Hans of the United States, was unsealed. Hans is being charged with Wire fraud, Computer fraud, as well as money laundering. Documents state that from April to July of 2016, Hans headed a series of fraud attacks against U.S. financial institutions where he pretended he was an authorized representative of the institutions. Once he pulled it off, he was then able to transfer money from said institutions corporate accounts for his own personal use.</p>
    <p>Hans is also being charged for his unauthorized access to a website that was run by the U.S. General Services Administration and redirecting money that was supposed to go to these institutions, into his own accounts.</p>
    <p>Hans appeared in court yesterday in front of Thomas O. Rice, United States District Judge. A detainment hearing was scheduled for today, to see whether Hans will be free or incarcerated until the time of his trial. Charges were announced by U.S. attorney Robert L. Capers and Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI, William F. Sweeney, Jr.</p>
    <p>Hans was accused with stealing $134,000 from a financial institution and for an attempted theft of $1.5 million more.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/cyber-criminal-charged-scheme-steal-more-15-million-us-financial-institution">A press release</a> on the DOJ website states:</p>
    <p>“<em>Posing as someone authorized to conduct financial transactions for the financial institution, the defendant misappropriated money from corporate bank accounts to buy shares of stock in publicly traded companies, invest in a real estate property in Brooklyn, and benefit his family members</em>. <em>He also conducted an unauthorized intrusion into the website SAM.gov, which stores information about companies that provide services to the federal government. During this unauthorized website intrusion, the defendant changed information in entries pertaining to the financial institution, including by replacing the bank account information. As a result, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation sent more than $1.5 million to the defendant instead of the financial institution.</em>”</p>
    <p>Hans was arrested in Richland, Washington on October 26<sup>th</sup>, 2016 after the criminal complaint was issued by the Eastern District of New York, but all charges are still allegations. Director in Charge, Sweeney issued this warning:</p>
    <p><em>Criminals who exploit the internet to commit crimes think they can hide behind the virtual veil of a computer screen. But just as today’s charges remind us that everyone is at risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime, so too should the public be reminded that the FBI will continue to be a major force in confronting those who think they can evade the law</em>.</p>
