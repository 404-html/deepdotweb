    <p>Frank Pina, a 57-year-old New Haven resident, just received an 81-month prison sentence from <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/pr/new-haven-man-sentenced-87-months-distributing-fentanyl-laced-cocaine-involved-spate">U.S. District Judge Michael P. Shea</a>. Shea sentenced Pina for distributing fentanyl-laced cocaine. His “cocaine” killed three New Haven residents in June alone. Pina himself overdosed on the concoction at least one time, court documents revealed.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/332822209/FRANK-PINA-Affidavit">According to said documents</a>, on June 23, seventeen people in New Haven overdosed on cocaine. Three victims died and those who remained gave statements to police. The DEA and New Haven Police Department (NHPD) interviewed the survivors for additional information. They learned that the hospitalized New Haven residents thought that they were using cocaine. However, Naloxone revitalized many of the patients—an indication that opioids were involved. Then the DEA and NHPD opened an investigation into the deaths and overdoses. DEA laboratories confirmed that <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/fentanyl/">the cause of death was pure fentanyl</a>.</p>

    <p>The DEA began working with confidential informants.They pointed to Frank. Court documents revealed that a CI knew Frank well. The CI told Allyn Wright, the DEA agent who worked the case, that &#8220;Frank has sold cocaine for years.&#8221; After officers made several positive identifications, they obtained a warrant. They hacked his phone, recorded conversations, and &#8220;reproduced stored information.&#8221; Then, after obtaining witness reports and electronic data, officers made the arrest.</p>
    <p>“This defendant sold cocaine laced with fentanyl creating a lethal cocktail that tragically stole three lives,” said U.S. Attorney Daly. “He himself spent three days in the hospital having overdosed on the same toxic mixture. His crime is all the more revealing as he was fully aware of the acute danger of the cocaine he was peddling.</p>

    <p>Special Agent in Charge added:</p>
    <p>Anytime there is a loss of life involving a drug overdose it is a tragic event; but even more so in this case given the number of victims in less than one day. Those suffering from the disease of fentanyl and heroin addiction need access to treatment and recovery. But, those responsible for distributing these lethal drugs to the citizens of New Haven need to be held accountable for their actions. In response to the ongoing opioid epidemic, DEA and its local, state and federal partners are committed to bringing to justice those that distribute this poison.</p>
    <p>On August 4, Pina pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances. He additionally pleaded guilty to the distribution of controlled substances.</p>
    <p>District Judge Michael P. Shea sentenced Pina to 81-months in prison and 4-years on parole.</p>
