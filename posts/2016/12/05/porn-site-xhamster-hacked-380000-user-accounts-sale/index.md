    <p>Over 100,000 user accounts on the porn site xHamster are trading and selling on the Darknet right now.</p>
    <p>Over 380,000 users have been found by the breach notification website LeakBase. The <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/hackers-are-trading-hundreds-of-thousands-of-xhamster-porn-account-details">xHamster data base</a> includes usernames, emails, and a score of not so hashed passwords.</p>
    <p>More than 12 million people use xHamster, and although it’s a free subscription, users are encouraged to upload their own videos to the site. In a research analysis, 50 of the leaked user accounts were tried, and all 50 came back as active accounts, suggesting the leak is accurate.</p>
    <p>Among the multitude of emails in the database, 40 were found to belong to the United States military, and another 30 to different United States, United Kingdom, and numerous other countries government agencies. Leakbase has said that the accounts started trading around the time a hacker came forward with a vulnerability he had found. None of the entities belonging to the emails in the database would respond for comments.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16749 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image.png" width="405" height="375" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image.png 612w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-300x277.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px"/></p>
    <p>A separate analysis was done on the database to make sure that the accounts weren’t already publicly available on the open internet. The analysis provided that the information contained in the database was in fact freshly hacked, and newly leaked to the internet.</p>
    <p>xHamster released a statement saying:</p>
    <p><em>The passwords of all xHamster users are properly encrypted, so it is almost impossible to hack them. Thus, all passwords are safe and the user’s data secured</em>.</p>
    <p>A test ran on the hashes found in the database showed that this statement was false. The hashes were created with the oldest algorithm, MD5; which hackers have proven to be easily accessible to them. There are also several websites that enable the user to look up the plaintext version of already cracked hashes.</p>
    <p>xHamster users should have been urged to change their passwords, even if they were “properly” encrypted. They also should have been told to change any other passwords on different websites that matched their xHamster password. Hackers have long been able to find ways to access other accounts belonging to users within leaked databases.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/30/yahoo-announces-500m-accounts-compromised/">Yahoo</a> and several others have seen massive data breaches recently, and hacking is on the rise in many forms these days. Releasing a statement saying your information and accounts are safe and protected after a major data breach such as this is simply foolish. Even companies that have more advanced encryption processes still urge users to change passwords after a breach.</p>
    <p>If you don’t know anything about proper cyber security, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/">websites</a> that offer <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/security-tutorials/">tutorials and even step by step instructions on the proper methods of cyber security</a>. Too often people simply brush off the fact that they could very well become a hackers next victim. xHamster itself is doing so, even after the fact that they have just had a major data breach with poorly encrypted passwords.</p>
