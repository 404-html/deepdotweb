    <p>In early December, a judge at Truro Crown Court sentenced Justin Paul Young to eight years in prison. Young, the former owner of Fal Fixings Ltd, pleaded guilty to several <a href="http://www.cornwalllive.com/penryn-businessman-facing-charges-gun-running/story-28898446-detail/story.html">illegal weapons charges last year</a>. Judge Simon Carr previously set a sentencing date for Young but the defendant passed out in front of the courthouse and received a new court date. On December 2, Young, again, passed out in front of the courthouse.</p>
    <p>Prior to the first sentencing hearing, Young passed out and authorities rushed him to the hospital. Judge Carr gave the man some leniency and rescheduled his court date. Young’s defense spoke about the man’s declining mental health status and Judge Carr agreed.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16909 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-16.jpeg" width="878" height="494" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-16.jpeg 1920w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-16-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-16-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px" /> The hearing was not impacted this time, however. Young passed out after drinking “<a href="http://www.cornwalllive.com/gun-running-penryn-businessman-justin-young-jailed-despite-taking-overdose-outside-court/story-29952515-detail/story.html">the majority of a bottle of whiskey and a large amount of prescribed medication</a>.” Police arrested him outside the courthouse and, yet again, rushed him to the hospital. As Young lost consciousness, he handed police officers a letter intended for his family. The letter informed his wife and children that he aimed to take his own life with the overdose.</p>
    <p>After a long period of discussion, Judge Carr said: &#8220;I appreciate this is a very difficult position but Mr. Young has twice waited until he arrived at court to make the dramatic gesture. We have given him the benefit of the doubt before so it is my opinion that we must proceed to sentence today.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Mr. Feest, QC prosecution, explained Young’s darknet crimes to the court. He said investigators followed a trail to the now-convicted Penryn man after a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/germany/">darknet investigation in Germany</a>. German police investigated a German national for suspected illegal arms trade on the darknet. The police seized two packages addressed to the defendant. Both packages contained illegal assault rifle parts.</p>
    <p>Upon further investigation, authorities discovered Young bought numerous firearm components on the darknet. According to the prosecution, Young purchased the parts from darknet vendors in America and Austria. They described bitcoin and the lack of a “cash trail” that the virtual currency incorporated. Young made the investigation even more difficult by disguising packages, ordering them to his business address, and using different aliases.</p>
    <p>Feest briefly explained the final stages of the case:</p>
    <p>Authorities in this country were notified and launched an undercover operation where dummy parts were inserted into packages and delivered to Mr. Young&#8217;s work address which he was only too happy to sign for. After he was arrested one of Mr. Young&#8217;s first acts was to return to the dark web and warn others that the police were aware. Mr. Young sourced materials from three countries and each supplier was arrested and cooperated with authorities.</p>
    <p>Undercover police arrested Young after a controlled delivery in 2015. They intercepted one of his packages, replaced the illegal parts with non-functioning ones, and delivered the package. The agents posed as postal workers and arrested Young once he signed for the packages. During interrogation, Young refused to reveal the location of his weapons or weapon parts.</p>
    <p>Judge Simon Carr sentenced Young to eight years in prison on three counts illegally importing firearm components. He said that prison officials needed to be made aware of Young’s mental health problems.</p>
