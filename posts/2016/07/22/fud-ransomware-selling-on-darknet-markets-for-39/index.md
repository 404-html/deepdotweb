    <p>While drugs may still be the main focus of markets on the deepweb, a new wave of product has the potential to cause some uproar in the community. According to <a href="https://www.hackread.com/hackers-selling-stampado-ransomware/">HackRead</a>, some of the most deadly ransomware to ever exist has become available for less than $40. The ransomware, named Stampado, gives the victim 96 hours to pay to have their computer unlocked. After 96 hours, data starts disappearing. And it&#8217;s fully undetectable at this point.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stampado.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14867" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stampado.jpg" alt="stampado" width="768" height="415" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stampado.jpg 768w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stampado-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></a></p>
    <p>If you&#8217;ve been paying attention to the news lately, you may be aware that the usage of ransomware is becoming far more common. Ransomware is a term used to describe a piece of software that takes control of a victim&#8217;s computer and holds the data hostage. Until the owner pays to access his personal information, the ransomware will start deleting files at random. Eventually, if the bounty is never paid, there won&#8217;t be any files left to recover.</p>
    <p>Stampado, the ransomware that&#8217;s making the news, is a huge threat to anyone who values their data. The virus, as stated before, is completely undetectable by current anti-virus software. Not only that, but it also does not require administrator permissions or privileges to install. Once the program is executed, the take-over begins. Below is a picture of the seller describing his software. He lets potential buyers know that it&#8217;s incredibly simple to operate; all that&#8217;s needed is an email account. He warns, however, not to run the program through any online anti-virus scanners, such as Google&#8217;s VirusTotal, as they distribute the data to other anti-virus companies.</p>
    <p>Selling any sort of malicious software is illegal, but the cover the deepweb provides may be enough to keep the seller safe from law enforcement. Just recently. in 2014, two men <a href="https://www.hackread.com/malware-encryption-service-privder-couple-arrested/">were arrested</a> for offering a service that keeps viruses hidden from anti-virus software. They weren&#8217;t selling their service on the deepweb, but with the amount of news Stampado is generating, even the deepweb may not protect them.</p>
    <p>The best defense in times like these, when anti-virus software is rendered useless, is to be cautious when downloading files and opening links in emails. Don&#8217;t download anything you don&#8217;t trust.</p>
