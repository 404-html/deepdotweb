    <p>Moynul Haque (21), a Smethwick man who bought Glock handgun parts from the dark net, <a href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/man-who-bought-glock-pistol-11538095">was jailed</a> for 10 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court following a joint investigation by the National Crime Agency and the US Department of Homeland Security.</p>
    <p>Haque ordered the gun from a dark net vendor based in the US, Michigan, which was supposed to contain an antique radio, however, officers at US customs examined the parcel and found a pistol slide, barrel and recoil spring for a Glock 9mm handgun inside. As the package arrived to the Birmingham border investigation team, they alerted the NCA who executed a warrant at Haque’s home.</p>
    <p>At the house of the 21-year-old, authorities seized electronic devices, such as the man’s laptop and a small package containing amphetamine.</p>
    <p>NCA agents, with the assistance of the West Midlands Police Cyber Crime Unit, found out that Haque bought the handgun for £900, and had attempted to check the status of the parcel online.</p>
    <p>Haque pleaded guilty to the importation of firearms and possession of class B drugs and was sentenced to 10 months in prison at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Dawn Cartwright, head of the NCA’s Birmingham border investigation team, made this statement:</p>
    <p>“This investigation relied on the cooperation of our law enforcement partners here in the UK and in the United States. Together we have successfully prevented a potentially lethal weapon making it onto the streets of the West Midlands.”</p>
