    <p>Only 2 days ago we reported about <a title="Permalink to New Breach: 655000 Healthcare Records (Patients) Being Sold" href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/06/26/655000-healthcare-records-patients-being-sold/" rel="bookmark">655000 Healthcare Records (Patients) Being Sold</a>,by an anonymous hacker on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/therealdeal-market/">TheRealDeal market</a>, at that time the hacker called <span class="mbg-nw"><strong>thedarkoverlord</strong> (trdealmgn4uvm42g.onion/profile/32184)</span> promised that we should expect more &#8211; and soon after, he delivered in the form of a new sale of hacked Healthcare Insurance Database containing no less than 9,300,000 patients records from United States:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hackerrecords.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14648" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hackerrecords.png" alt="hackerrecords" width="1006" height="429" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hackerrecords.png 1189w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hackerrecords-300x128.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hackerrecords-1024x437.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px" /></a></p>
    <p>The hacker stated on the sale page:</p>
    <blockquote><p>This product is an extremely large database in plaintext from a large insurance healthcare organization in the United States. It was retrieved using a 0day within the RDP protocol that gave direct access to this sensitive information.</p></blockquote>
    <p>The info contained in the database includes: Firstname,Lastname,Address1,City,State,Zip,Email,HomePhone,CellPhone,DOB,SSN</p>
    <p>The database is being sold for 750BTC &#8211; the which is around 485,000$ at this time.</p>
    <p>Dissent Doe, a security researcher <a href="https://www.databreaches.net/lording-it-over-the-healthcare-sector-health-insurer-database-with-9-3m-entries-up-for-sale/">reported on her blog</a> that she managed to verify that the data was real by calling on of the persons from the DB, using some sample listings provided to her by <span class="mbg-nw">thedarkoverlord, and concluded:</span></p>
    <blockquote><p>So the data look real, but some of it may be old. That’s not necessarily surprising, as many companies seem to be allergic to purging old data.</p></blockquote>
    <p>The hacker added in an encrypted chat with <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/">DeepDotWeb:</a></p>
    <blockquote><p>This hacked was done using Same RDP 0day from the previous released DB&#8217;s</p></blockquote>
    <p>He also said that the info is recent although some portions of it are indeed old.  When asked if he tried contacting the company he replied:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Contact was attempted with the victim organization. However, they declined to respond. The attempt was made with each of their board of director members</p></blockquote>
    <p>And also added:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Why not just pay? Money makes it all go away and it is a modest cost compared to the total financial damage you will suffer if you do not pay to keep it from getting leaked.</p></blockquote>
    <p>When asked if we should expect more leaks of personal info from the healthcare system, he replied:</p>
    <blockquote><p>We are just getting started!</p></blockquote>
    <p>We will keep following and updating, and can&#8217;t help wondering if those breached companies are being held accountable in anyway for not putting enough of their huge profits into protecting their most precious and private data.</p>
