    <p>Derrick Shelton, James Stewart and Quentin Stewart, all members of the Army National Guard, have been arrested and charged for ordering stolen credit card numbers and using them on military bases. The Justice Department said the men were using bitcoin to buy the card numbers online, then using card writing tools, they would make their own fakes.</p>
    <p>“The defendants selected to purchase stolen credit and debit card numbers of individuals and businesses holding federal credit union accounts, and those with billing addresses in or near Maryland. They bought magnetic strip card-encoding devices and software to re-encode credit, debit, and other cards with the stolen credit and debit card numbers,” a government release said.</p>
    <p>The crimes were committed between July 2014 and May 2015 the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland said.</p>
    <p>The government said that the home made cards were used to purchase electronics, gift cards, and other items from Army and Air Force Exchange Services on military bases.</p>
    <p>The three men are facing up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.</p>
    <p>Jamal Moody, another Guard member, has been indicted separately but was said to have committed similar offenses like purchasing stolen credit card and debit card numbers online. He had plead guilty and is waiting to be sentenced, a court report said.</p>
    <p>Vincent Grant is the fifth National Guard member to be indicted and is facing up to seven and a half years in prison for an access device fraud charge. All five of the member’s bases were in Washington, DC and Maryland.</p>
