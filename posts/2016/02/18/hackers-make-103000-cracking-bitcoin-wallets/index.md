    <p>Hackers have made about $103,000 cracking bitcoin wallets that were “secured” using BrainWallet.</p>
    <p>Not too long after a group of researchers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/103.pdf">published</a> a paper about efficiently cracking bitcoin BrainWallets, it was <a href="http://fc16.ifca.ai/preproceedings/36_Vasek.pdf">revealed</a> in a paper that there are a group of hackers who have already taken advantage of these weaknesses and have drained every wallet they could.</p>
    <p>“Surprisingly, after excluding activities by researchers, we identified just 884 brain wallets worth around $100K in use from September 2011 to August 2015. We find that all but 21 wallets were drained, usually within 24 hours but often within minutes. We find that around a dozen “drainers&#8221; are competing to liquidate brain wallets as soon as they are funded”</p>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet">brainwallet</a> “refers to the concept of storing Bitcoins in one&#8217;s own mind by memorization of a passphrase. As long as the passphrase is not recorded anywhere, the Bitcoins can be thought of as existing nowhere except in the mind of the holder. If a brainwallet is forgotten or the person dies or is permanently incapacitated, the Bitcoins are lost forever.”</p>
    <p>BrainWallets were created by turning passphrases into a 256-bit private key by hashing the passphrase with SHA256, that private key is then used to created a bitcoin address. Keep in mind that these aren&#8217;t salted and are only hashed once. You can easily run an offline password cracking attack on the private key since it&#8217;s no different than a password hash in a leaked database. Once you&#8217;ve cracked it, you essentially own the bitcoin address.</p>
    <p>In the paper, the researchers describe how the hackers found new brain wallets and how they drained them so quickly.</p>
    <p>“Drainers lurk over the blockchain, ready to pounce as soon as new brain wallets are established.”</p>
    <p>“Many bots monitor for new transactions depositing into known brain wallets. These drainers quickly send the money to their own addresses, often with a sizable fee to encourage miners to pick up the transaction quickly.”</p>
    <p>Because this is a group of hackers, one would think they would all closely profited the same amount, but this is not the case.</p>
    <p>“Nonetheless, we confirmed at least 14 drainers targeting multiple brain wallets, corroborated by reports on discussion forums.</p>
    <p>A few drainers are very successful while the rest do not make very much. The top 4 drainers have netted the equivalent of $35,000 between them. The drainer who has emptied the most brain wallets &#8212; 100 in all &#8212; has earned $3219 for the</p>
    <p>effort. But other drainers have stolen very little money. For example, one drainer</p>
    <p>stole from 78 different brain wallets but netted only $62 worth of bitcoin.”</p>
    <p>The paper that details these findings, “The Bitcoin Brain Drain: A Short Paper on the</p>
    <p>Use and Abuse of Bitcoin Brain Wallets” is scheduled to be presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference.</p>
