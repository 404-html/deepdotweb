    <p>Karolina Marzantowicz, the IBM Distinguished Engineer, will speak on September 23 at the annual <a href="http://goo.gl/9ywZgc">Blockchain &amp; Bitcoin Conference.</a> She will talk about how the global project Hyperledger is designed and what business problems it solves.</p>
    <p>Hyperledger is a world-renowned project initiated by Linux Foundation. It was launched in December of 2015. It is a system of smart contracts for companies within the overall network. The main objective of this project is to enable companies to build their own solutions based on blockchain.</p>
    <p>Immediately after its start, a number of crypto currency and blockchain start-ups, as well as consulting firms, mass media and companies protecting intellectual property have joined the project. One of the key participants of the project is IBM.</p>
    <p>The topic of the report to be delivered by Karolina Marzantowicz is as follows: Hyperledger architecture and its main components.</p>
    <p>The speaker will explain what is the essence of the new approach to the traditional blockchain model, what the concept of &#8220;general ledger&#8221; means and what needs of the modern business are met by the project.</p>
    <p>Karolina Marzantowicz is engaged in the IBM technical adaptation to the rapidly changing IT environment. To bring the company to the individual and to set up the technology solving the most complex business situations, these are the issues to be resolved by the speaker&#8217;s team.</p>
    <p>According to Smile-Expo, the conference organizer, the event will include three intensive course groups: educative, expert and the separate one for developers. Read about event preparations on the website of <a href="http://goo.gl/9ywZgc">Blockchain &amp; Bitcoin Conference.<br/>
