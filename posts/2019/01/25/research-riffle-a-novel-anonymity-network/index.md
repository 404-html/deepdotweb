    <p>Riffle is a communication system designed at MIT to address the problems associated with the Tor network. Riffle is a unique anonymity network that implements a verifiable shuffle and is believed to be ten times faster than the Tor network. According to <a href="https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/riffle-pets2016.pdf">an article published as part of 2016&#8217;s Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Anonymity</a>, researchers from MIT and Qatar&#8217;s Computing Research Institute developed the Riffle protocol to address <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/01/08/onion-router-darkweb-overview-current-state-vulnerabilities/">vulnerabilities of the Tor protocol</a>.</p>
    <p>Throughout this article, we will overview the Riffle communication system.</p>

    <p><strong>What is Riffle?</strong></p>
    <p>Riffle is a computation and bandwidth efficient communication protocol with powerful anonymity features. Riffle is composed of a small group of anonymity servers as well as a large number of clients, and it provides all honest clients with high levels of anonymity, provided that there is a minimum of a single honest server across the network. Riffle utilizes a novel verifiable hybrid shuffle technique and a private data retrieval system for computation and bandwidth efficient forms of anonymous communications.</p>
    <p><strong>Evaluation and the unique features of the Riffle protocol:</strong></p>
    <p>Evaluation of the Riffle protocol in micro-blogging and file sharing applications has proven that Riffle can provide a bandwidth of 100KB/s per user within an anonymity group of 200 users with file sharing applications and serve over 100,000 users with a latency of less than 10 seconds with micro-blogging applications.</p>
    <p>Riffle solves the problems associated with verifiable mixnets and DC-Nets, while providing users with the same anonymity levels. The protocol is focused on minimization of clients&#8217; bandwidth consumption, especially as some clients may be connecting through bandwidth-constrained devices, such as their smartphones, and minimization of computation overhead on the network servers so that they can support as many clients as possible. Technically speaking, clients on the Riffle network will only consume upstream bandwidth which is directly proportional to their message size, rather than the overall number of clients across the network. Also, server computation involves only high speed symmetric key cryptography. This renders users capable of exchanging messages in an efficient manner, which makes Riffle suitable for file sharing applications, which are usually not supported by other anonymity systems. Furthermore, Riffle offers all clients high levels of anonymity, provided that a minimum of one honest server is present on the network.</p>
    <p>The Riffle communication system achieves computation and bandwidth efficiency via implementation of two privacy primitives: private information retrieval (PIR) for securing downstream communications and a novel verifiable hybrid shuffle for securing upstream communications. Riffle&#8217;s novel verifiable hybrid shuffle protocol avoids the usage of a costly verifiable shuffle along the critical path and implements unauthenticated encryption to boost computation and bandwidth overhead of the hybrid shuffle without loss of the verifiability. Developers of Riffle also introduce a new application for retrieval of private information within an anytrust setting.</p>
    <p>Previously developed powerful anonymity protocols made a trade-off between bandwidth and computation via either broadcasting all network messages to all clients (high bandwidth, low computation) or utilizing PIR which is computationally expensive (low bandwidth, high computation). Within an anytrust model, developers of Riffle proved that PIR can reduce the bandwidth of download with low computation overhead.</p>
    <p><strong>The Riffle prototype:</strong></p>
    <p>Developers of Riffle created a prototype and tested it with two applications: a file sharing application and a micro-blogging application.</p>
    <p>File sharing application:</p>
    <p>An anonymous file sharing application was developed and tested across the Riffle network. With a file sharing application, each searched message is of large volume and is mostly of interest to only a small proportion of users across the network. Within a group on Riffle, file sharing is a bit similar to what takes place via the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/12/31/torrenting-dark-net/">BitTorrent protocol</a> despite the differences between the two protocols (peer-to-peer model in BitTorrent and client-server model in Riffle).</p>
    <p>When a client shares a file, they create a torrent file, which includes the hashes of the blocks, which are the smallest units used in file sharing, of the file. Thereafter, the client will upload the torrent file to Riffle&#8217;s servers. The servers will serve as the torrent trackers on the BitTorrent protocol, managing all files available within a group. With the distribution of torrent files, clients can share files in an anonymous manner via Riffle.</p>
    <p>Micro-blogging application:</p>
    <p>Developers of Riffle created a micro-blogging application via creating thousands of clients, each of whom published a small message (160-320 bytes) per round. At the end of each round, all messages were broadcast onto the network. The application was shown to support around 10,000 clients with a latency of less than one second with 160 byte messages. If the sent messages can bear some delay, the application was shown to support more than 100,000 users with latency of less than 10 seconds.</p>
    <p>The developed prototype has proven to be effective for both applications: file sharing and micro-blogging. With the file sharing application, the prototype managed to achieve high bandwidth levels (&gt; 100 KB/s) for over 200 clients. With the micro-blogging application, the prototype was shown to be able to support &gt;100,000 clients with latency of no more than one second.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></p>
    <p>Riffle is a novel anonymous communication network that offers powerful anonymity and strong resistance against traffic analysis attacks, while minimizing the computation and bandwidth overhead. Riffle has shown that it can mitigate the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/03/30/tor-browser-fully-anonymous-myth-reality/">vulnerabilities of Tor</a> and can be more useful for users than other anonymity communication systems such as Freenet and I2P. Riffle has also shown that it offers high levels of anonymity for clients interested in file sharing, which is a feature that cannot be offered by Tor.</p>
