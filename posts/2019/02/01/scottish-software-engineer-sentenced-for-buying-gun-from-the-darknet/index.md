    <p>A 48 year old Scottish man has been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-46863674">convicted</a> of three <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/firearm/">firearms</a> related charges and sentenced to 5 years in prison by the High Court in Edinburgh for trying to buy and import a gun from the darknet. David Mitchell of Damside, Edinburgh, pleaded guilty to the three criminal firearms charges that had been filed against him after he was accused of the crimes by law enforcement agents with the Police Service of Scotland. Mr. Mitchell is a single man with no children who had a career as a software engineer. The criminal case against Mr. Mitchell was the result of an international investigation. Law enforcement agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom investigated the case after the firearm was discovered in the mail before being sent out of the United States.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement claimed that David Mitchell had spent over 2,000 British Pounds worth of cryptocurrency in his attempt to obtain a firearm from a vendor on the darknet. The man had tried to buy and import a 9mm Glock handgun, a sound suppressor (commonly known as a “silencer”), and 150 rounds of 9mm ammunition. Mr. Mitchell attempted to have the gun, sound suppressor, and ammunition sent to his business office in Dunfermline, Fife. Law enforcement agents from the United States informed Scottish law enforcement agents of Mr. Mitchell’s firearms shipment on September 19<sup>th</sup> of last year. The British/Scottish law enforcement investigation into Mr. Mitchell was dubbed “Operation Dive” and was part of a joint law enforcement task force known as the Organised Crime Partnership, which is made up of agents from the Police Service of Scotland and the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/10/the-uk-creates-new-dark-net-task-force/">National Crime Agency</a>.</p>
    <p>The Organised Crime Partnership task force has been in the works for years and was officially conceived of on September 1<sup>st</sup> of last year, but it was not until only a few weeks before the investigation of David Mitchell that the task force finally launched. The Mitchell case marks the first case that the Organised Crime Partnership has investigated and the first time the existence of the task force had been brought to the attention of the public. The task force consists of 30 law enforcement agents, made up of 15 law enforcement agents from the National Crime Agency and 15 law enforcement agents from the Police Service of Scotland, with plans to expand the number of task force agents from both law enforcement agencies. The Organised Crime Partnership task force has enabled Scottish police to collaborate with the National Crime Agency’s 150 liason officers that are located in 50 countries around the globe. The task force focuses on combating drug traffickers, gun runners, and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/07/10/nca-wants-tech-companies-to-prevent-pedophiles-from-uploading-images/">child pornographers</a>.</p>
    <p>Scottish law enforcement agents created a fake package to resemble the one that was seized by postal inspectors. This dummy package was referred to by law enforcement agents as a “placebo” and was created to protect public safety by ensuring Mr. Mitchell did not actually possess the lethal weapon he had ordered. Agents with the Organised Crime Partnership task force then used the placebo to do a controlled delivery on Mr. Mitchell. The law enforcement agents with the task force monitored Mr. Mitchell as he signed for and received the placebo package at his business office. Mr. Mitchell had partially opened the placebo package and then placed it in the trunk of his car. He then drove to his home and went inside with the placebo package. Minutes after arriving and going inside of his home, law enforcement agents with the Organised Crime Partnership entered the house with a search warrant. They located the placebo package under Mr. Mitchell’s couch.</p>
    <p>David Mitchell admitted in court to committing the 3 firearms charges and was sentenced to 5 years in prison by Judge Lord Pentland. “It appears that you formed a plan to obtain these items by carrying out research on the dark web and then proceeding to order them for delivery to this country from the United States,” the judge said during Mitchell’s sentencing. “Fortunately, due to cooperation between the police forces of both countries, your plan was thwarted, and the items were intercepted. It appears that your decision to acquire the gun and the other items arose from an obsessive preoccupation on your part with exploring whether it was possible to do so by making use of the dark web.” The judge said that despite the fact that Mitchell maintains he had no plans of causing harm to anyone by obtaining the gun, he must be punished.</p>
