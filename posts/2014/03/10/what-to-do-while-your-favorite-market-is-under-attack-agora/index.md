    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Update</strong></span>: The Agora team just posted an update indicating that they are on the right direction with solving the ddos issues (original thread can be found here: http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,4290.0/topicseen.html): <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agonline.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4629" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agonline.png" alt="agonline" width="626" height="165" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agonline.png 1175w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agonline-300x79.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agonline-1024x270.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px"/></a></p>

    <p>Yes, we know that Agora is down, everyone knows that agora is is down &#8211; its been up and down with this recent attack for the past 2 weeks, so i cant believe there is someone who did not notice that yet. im writing this as a response to the 20 &#8211; 30 mails we are getting every day requesting us to report the fact that agora is down due to attack / cyber war / ddos or what ever other reason, since you probably tried to access the market and got this message, this is not news to you:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unable.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4616" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unable.png" alt="unable" width="715" height="324" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unable.png 715w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unable-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px"/></a></p>
    <p>Also im sure you all saw the official response from the Agora admins by now:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agoraadmin.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4617" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agoraadmin.png" alt="agoraadmin" width="786" height="267" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agoraadmin.png 1191w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agoraadmin-300x102.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agoraadmin-1024x348.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px"/></a></p>
    <p><em>UPDATE 03/10/14 0012 UTC</em></p>
    <p><em>We are still working to mitigate the DoS attack. While the situation has improved some we can not yet say it is resolved. Our staff is working hard to further improve accessibility.</em><br/>
    <em>All funds are accounted for and we are monitoring the situation closely.</em></p>
    <p><em>*****</em></p>
    <p><em>The allegations of a &#8220;hack&#8221; are not based on anything, we are monitoring everything and no info has been leaked as far as we can see.</em><br/>
    <em>It seems their idea of a &#8220;hack&#8221; is a DDoS attack on the server (which does indeed go on right now, and as all DoS attacks, can result in denial of service) and a brute-force attack on the login system to try to find out users&#8217; passwords.</em></p>
    <p><em>As a precaution, if you use a weak password, or the same password as on some other service that has been hacked, you should change that immediately.</em></p>
    <p><em>As a countermeasure for this attack we have now implemented a captcha-check on the login form. Sorry for this inconvenience, but it seems to be better than letting the attackers brute-force passwords easily.</em></p>
    <p>You probably saw the claims from a &#8220;hacker&#8221; who got hold of some vendor accounts, this is of course just FUD &#8211; some accounts were hacked because they were using VERY weak passwords, that&#8217;s all (im not going to quote this thread here)</p>
    <p>We can only agree that this is without a doubt. a big problem and another disappointment to the Darknet community, one we can only hope that will not end with financial loss for many people, it is advise to try and access the market every one and than in order to withdraw any funds you might have left on the marketplace.</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In the meantime, here are some things you can do to the pass the time while your favorite market is down:</strong></span><br/>
    (its agora in this case, but it can work in most cases as well)<br/>
    <em>* Needless to say that we mean no offense by this &#8211; its all in humor.</em></p>
