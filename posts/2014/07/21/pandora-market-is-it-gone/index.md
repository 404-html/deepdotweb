    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Update</strong><strong>:  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Market is back up:  This was the Statement from the Admin:</span></strong></span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <div class="list_posts" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sorry guys, my bad, pandora will be back up soon, just serios technical issues combined with holiday time. I am Sorry for that shit !</strong></span></div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Story before was:</p>
    <p>The same ritual every 2 months. So we can&#8217;t say that we did not see this one coming&#8230; <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/pandora-market">Pandora market</a> the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/05/12/darknetmarkets-listing-count-is-booming-53917/">fourth largest market</a> (had around 8000 listings at this time) and one of the oldest post-silk road1 markets which already encountered a fair share of problems, consist of a series of issues during the previous months including the famous &#8220;hack&#8221; that raised the fees to 25%. Just to name a few:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>But the market seems to be down for the past week and we did our best to say nothing until now, but since we receive many emails asking about what happened to Pandora &#8211; and we have no idea obviously, we can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only assume</strong></span> its something along these lines:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gone1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6494" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gone1.jpg" alt="gone[1]" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gone1.jpg 480w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gone1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
    <p>Alice, the market admin is no where to be found, the forums are still though. We could only hope that after the so called hack few months ago there were not so many users on the market so not much money is lost, but since this market was around for a while, and was the fourth largest market according to most of the statistics done during this time, we can safely assume that a large sum of money IS in fact lost &#8211; assuming it won&#8217;t be back of course.</p>
    <p><strong>Even if this market will come back at some point it is advised to proceed with extreme caution in case you decide <strong>to keep using this market</strong> from some reason (We had a couple of cases where Alice was gone for a while and came back later to fix the issue)<br />
    </strong></p>
    <p>We will try and get some more details and update, but as we experienced from previous marketplace scams that were just &#8220;gone&#8221; without much notice &#8211; like with <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/01/sheep-is-now-officially-down/">Sheep</a>,  <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/23/reports-tormarket-scam-in-progress/">Tormarket</a> and <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/22/torescrow-marketplace-happend/">Torescrow</a>, we wont be holding our breathe waiting for followup or any further details.</p>
    <p>This post will be updated with a notice in case the market will be back online in the next week or so, if not,  the market will be moved to the dead markets section in the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">Hidden marketplace list</a>, and will be removed from the sidebar uptime monitor.</p>
    <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to proceed from here</strong>?</span></h2>
    <p>Simple:</p>

    <p>Sorry for those who have their money stuck / lost on Pandora, and hopefully this will be sorted and won&#8217;t happen again (but we can safely assume it probably will).</p>
