    <p class="post-box-title">About a month ago we posted a <a title="Permalink to Warning: PMMA Sold As Red/Blue Hearts 130mg MDMA Pills" href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/06/09/warning-pmma-sold-as-redblue-hearts-130mg-mdma-pills/" rel="bookmark">Warning about PMMA Sold As Red/Blue Hearts 130mg MDMA Pills</a> on <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/agora-market">agora market</a>,  the listing were taken down and buyers were refunded by the market, but many of the them were left with large amounts of fake and possibly deadly pills with nothing to do with them &#8211; one user specifically demonstrated extraordinary responsibility by posting a proof online that he flushed all the fake pills down the toilet instead collecting his refund money and still selling the pills, and by doing so &#8211;  risking more unsuspecting buyers. On a Reddit post made this buyer <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2bi309/thanks_for_reminding_me_whats_important_flushed_em/">here</a> under the title &#8220;Thanks for reminding me what&#8217;s important &#8211; Flushed &#8217;em&#8221;, he said:</p>
    <blockquote><p>I put a post up a few days ago inquiring about interest in the 3k of those fake pills from Gargamella that I had possession of. The community responded loudly what I should do with them. I had a couple private messages and even an offer that was close to what I asked.</p>
    <p>I flushed them. Between the responses and upvotes, it was clear what needed to be done.</p>
    <p>I&#8217;m sorry that I even asked but thank all of you for steering me right.</p></blockquote>

    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6597" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4.jpg" alt="PMA fake pills - Empty" width="546" height="307" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4.jpg 4128w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></a></p>
    <p>That was after a previous thread he posted, asking if anyone wants to buy the fake pills:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fake.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6593" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fake.png" alt="fake" width="860" height="187" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fake.png 860w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fake-300x65.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></a><br />
    Almost all the replies in this thread urged him to throw them away. And as mentioned above, this is what he did.</p>
    <p>This is another fine example for how the Dark Net Markets are self regulating markets, without anyone forcing them to do so, in this case:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Market got rid of a vendor selling substances that were labeled in a misleading way &#8211; placing buyers under serious health risks.</li>
    <li>Market refunded the money to the buyers</li>
    <li>Buyer that have both the product and the money decides to get rid of the product instead of re selling it again &#8211; even though he claims to receive offers to buy them.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We can only hope that the other buyers of those pills decided to do the same.</p>
