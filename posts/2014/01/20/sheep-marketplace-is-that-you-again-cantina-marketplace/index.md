    <p><strong>The main story:</strong></p>
    <p>Ok Ok, I dont know if its a a joke or for real, but i just came across this new marketplace that looks <strong>EXACTLY</strong> like sheep marketplace, its called Cantina Marketplace:</p>
    <div id="attachment_3554" style="width: 457px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cantine.png"><img class=" wp-image-3554 " alt="cantine" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cantine.png" width="447" height="355" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cantine.png 1116w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cantine-300x239.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cantine-1024x815.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cantina Marketplace</p></div>
    <p>This is how Sheep Marketplace looked like just before it was taken down by its scammer owners:</p>
    <div id="attachment_3555" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sheep.png"><img class=" wp-image-3555" alt="sheep" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sheep.png" width="450" height="284" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sheep.png 1170w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sheep-300x190.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sheep-1024x649.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sheep marketplace &#8211; just before it went down</p></div>
    <p>The new market even made a cool new video advertisement on YouTube like the  Atlantis market (another market who went down with many of the users BTC) had before they went down:</p>
    <div align="center"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/t2srkfXtNSQ" height="260" width="461" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" align="middle"></iframe></div>
    <p>Several claims were published on the forums that the guys from the new market Apparently are offering &#8216;select&#8217; vendors free vendor accounts, which are normally $500 according to the PM they are sending the vendors:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Hello,<br/>
    I am contacting you on behalf of the Cantina Marketplace.<br/>
    Your great reputation has caught my eye and we would be very pleased if you joined us. Therefore I welcome you with a vendor account, going for 500$, free of charge.</p>
    <p>Being one of only a few merchants we are offering this to gives you a great opportunity to become a top rated vendor early on and before anyone else.</p>
    <p>If you are interested please make sure to check in regularly in the next few weeks as we are launching an extensive advertising campaign aimed at bringing many buyers into the marketplace.</p>
    <p>For information on some of the improvements we offer you can watch the video at (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2srkfXtNSQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)</p>
    <p>Assuming that you would like to join us please register a vendor account with the name you are using here, send a message to &#8220;Admin&#8221; and I will fund your account the amount needed to become a vendor.</p>
    <p>We will not publicize the marketplace to the public for the next 48 hours, please check in for sales after that time.<br/>

    <p>For those of you who needs a reminder &#8211; Sheep marketplace was the biggest <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/11/30/sheep-marketplace-scammed-over-40000000-in-the-biggets-darknet-scam-ever/" target="_blank">darknet scam ever</a>, stealing over $40M in bitcoins from its users. we wont jump into conclusion about this new one, but who would design a site that looks EXACTLY like the biggest scam site that ever was? i just can decide if we should add this market to our list at this point&#8230;.</p>
