    <p>This is a great post we found on the Silk Road forums &#8211; taken from the old forums (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210987) and now posted in this url (http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=596.0) by a user called Oneiros Distribution &#8211; explaining how to cash out bitcoins using pre paid visa cards trough some polish bank, it started some debate if such information should be released or not, but since it was posted on the old forums and the new forums, we would guess its pretty well known by now so people might as well use it while its still working (it was confirmed as working by several users on the forums)</p>
    <p>You can find on the same thread some vendors selling those pre paid card for easier access, we have edited the formatting for easier reading and added the images intext. enjoy:</p>
    <p><strong>A) Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>For those unaware there&#8217;s a Polish Bank named Bank Zachodni WBK who issue Anonymous Prepaid VISA Cards with their own IBAN. This Enables the Possibility of Moving Funds from Bitcoin Exchanges to these Types of Cards and then using it either to withdraw Funds from an Automated Teller Machine ( ATM ) or simply buying something Online. The primary three Variants of these Cards utilized are for the three Currencies EUR/Euro, GPB/Pound Sterling and USD/United States Dollar. If the Cards are used in a Transaction which Corresponds with the Currency of the Card itself there will be no additional Charges, however if the Currency doesn&#8217;t match up Bank Zachodni WBK will Charge a small Fee per Transaction. For specifics on the Terms of Use and Rules regarding the Cards refer to the Images in Section B) Physical Contents.</p>
    <p><strong>B) Physical Contents</strong></p>
    <p>When Orderings these Cards they are always Included in a Letter sent from Bank Zachodni WBK &#8211; I&#8217;ll include some Scanned Images of the Letter and the Contents inside. I&#8217;ve censored certain parts with green color with a black border around each such part.</p>
    <p>The Letter dimensions are width 22.80 cm and height 11.30 cm, it weighs between 28.60 to 28.80 grams. A scan of the Front/back respectively of the Letter:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kwqm1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3140" alt="Kwqm[1]" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kwqm1.jpg" width="221" height="431" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kwqm1.jpg 960w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kwqm1-154x300.jpg 154w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kwqm1-524x1024.jpg 524w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px"/></a><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/F2MO1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3141" alt="F2MO[1]" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/F2MO1.jpg" width="223" height="435" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/F2MO1.jpg 960w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/F2MO1-154x300.jpg 154w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/F2MO1-524x1024.jpg 524w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px"/></a></p>
    <p>The handwritten &#8220;EU&#8221; at the left side is from the Vendor who probably does it to keep track of the type. This is how the Letter looks ripped opened on the inside:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Dotychczasowe Hasło</strong> ( Current/Old Password; The Password you used for registering the Account to begin with. )</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><strong> Nowe Hasło</strong> ( New Password; Your New Password, has to be 8-20 characters in length and there&#8217;s several restrictions on what characters can be used. )</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>Press the green button called &#8220;Zapisz&#8221; which translates into &#8220;Save&#8221;. Congratulations, you&#8217;ve now successfully Registered your Card.<br/>
    The Online Interface gives you access to detailed History over your Card(s) and most likely the function to send money to other Accounts ( haven&#8217;t investigated this Aspect so not familiar with how to use it ).</p>
    <p>The most important reason/point of registering online is the fact you get to change your PIN Code, and secondarily I personally use it to see whenever the money has arrived at one card ( if I move funds over to say four cards with the same Account I only need to confirm it&#8217;s arrived at one most of the time ).</p>
    <p>To transfer funds to your Card, simply take your IBAN and add the characters &#8220;PL&#8221; before, ie. PL##########################. For SWIFT (BIC code) use: WBKPPLPP</p>
    <p><strong>D) Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
    <p>D-01) Is it possible to register more than one card Per Person and what are the Terms set by the Bank on this matter?<br/>
    D-02) Are there any known cases of these cards being shutdown and if so, why?<br/>
    D-03) When withdrawing Money from the Cards one can see by logging in very specifically what ATM has been used down to a very narrow geographic location &#8211; does it have any relevance if one uses the exact same ATM for multiple different Cards? Ie. is there any risk Bank Zachodni WBK would flag Cards as suspicious if they see different people start withdrawing money from the exact same ATM in a very short time span?<br/>
    D-04) Is there any Information if this Type of Service might eventually Expire in the Future or is nothing known about this?<br/>
    D-05) Is there any way for a Bitcoin Exchange to verify the details used for Registering the Account? Ie. can they cross-reference the Name used on an Exchange with the one used for a specific IBAN?<br/>
    D-06) Is there any Information regarding their Policy of Freezing Accounts? I&#8217;ve seen it mentioned they can Freeze the Account for three months if one attempts to withdraw twice near midnight, anything other than this?</p>
    <p>D-01) Is it possible to register more than one card Per Person and what are the Terms set by the Bank on this matter?</p>
    <p>TMan99: You always register it in a fake name, thats how they are anonymous&#8230; I don&#8217;t see what you are asking.<br/>
    BioCanna: Its possible but if one card get flagged for suspicious behaviour all cards might get frozen.<br/>
    DrugsAndCash:  First of all you don&#8217;t have to register this cards but yes of course for 1 identity you can register 10 cards maximum. But registration is useless and just wasting time.<br/>
    everythingman: yes you can but what ? its anonimity card so you register it on fake data</p>
    <p>D-02) Are there any known cases of these cards being shutdown and if so, why?</p>
    <p>BioCanna: No, i havent encountered a blocked card(besides 3months block caused by double withdrawing around midnight).<br/>
    DrugsAndCash: Yes I&#8217;m victim of case you described. Card has been blocked due to many small transactions from different people as loadings so bank flagged it as card used to receive business payments what is strictly prohibited.<br/>
    everythingman: yes if you exceed a limit and if the bank have a suspicion to money laundering ( but its unlikely if you dont register few cards on the same name )</p>
    <p>D-03) When withdrawing Money from the Cards one can see by logging in very specifically what ATM has been used down to a very narrow geographic location &#8211; does it have any relevance if one uses the exact same ATM for multiple different Cards? Ie. is there any risk Bank Zachodni WBK would flag Cards as suspicious if they see different people start withdrawing money from the exact same ATM in a very short time span?</p>
    <p>BioCanna: Theres always risk but for now no one seems to check that matter and it works well .<br/>
    DrugsAndCash: This can&#8217;t be the reason for flagging or blocking card. Flagging or blocking card is caused only by discovering by bank that card is funded from illegal money like funds from paypal scams or stolen from another bank account.<br/>
    everythingman: low risk because you can withdraw about 150 -200 cash daily and the most step in this is never show you face on ATM camera. This card is to withdraw cash in short time &#8211; its to holiday expenses</p>
    <p>D-04) Is there any Information if this Type of Service might eventually Expire in the Future or is nothing known about this?</p>
    <p>BioCanna: Poland is bound to USA and its possible that one day strict policies like in USA will come here to Poland and those cards wont be so easy to aquire anonymously.<br/>
    DrugsAndCash: It won&#8217;t expire till goverment won&#8217;t change law so I think it will always exist.<br/>
    everythingman: i haven&#8217;t any information but i monitoring situation</p>
    <p>D-05) Is there any way for a Bitcoin Exchange to verify the details used for Registering the Account? Ie. can they cross-reference the Name used on an Exchange with the one used for a specific IBAN?</p>
    <p>BioCanna: Withdraw from bitcoin exchange will only go through if all data matches (banks and exchanges:name address&#8230;).<br/>
    DrugsAndCash: I can help you in this point by giving you exchanger which doesn&#8217;t require verification.<br/>
    everythingman: No they not verify you should find exchange which don&#8217;t interesting IBAN they clientc like btc-e , bitcurex itp</p>
    <p>D-06) Is there any Information regarding their Policy of Freezing Accounts? I&#8217;ve seen it mentioned they can Freeze the Account for three months if one attempts to withdraw twice near midnight, anything other than this?</p>
    <p>BioCanna: No, nothing that i know of.<br/>
    DrugsAndCash: Instant withdrawals after midnight can be the reason of freezing card so we don&#8217;t recommend it but you can decrease this risk by doing some payments in stores using card.<br/>
    everythingman: yes if you withdraw on 23;55 you can cash out next on 00;02 cus its new day and its suspicion for him. i think that its only my word</p>
    <p><strong>E) Potential Scams</strong></p>
    <p>Almost every Single Vendor who&#8217;s ever Offered or will ever Offer these Cards get Accusations of that the Information from the Cards have been Stolen and used to withdraw Funds from them. I&#8217;ve personally went through all Information I&#8217;ve been able to find on this Subject and there is unfortunately no Conclusive Information or Evidence. However if anyone has Trouble with this in the Future post here and answer the following Questions:</p>
    <p>* Can you remember if the Letter looked tampered with?<br/>
    * What type of Card was it, ie. USD, EUR, or GPB?<br/>
    * Was the Card registered Online ( ie. did you change the PIN ) ?<br/>
    * What did the Information say online about where the Money went ( they have VERY specific Information available if it&#8217;s through ATM ) ?<br/>
    * At what exact time/date did the Money disappear, when was money Deposited into the Account?</p>
    <p><strong>F) Final Notes</strong></p>
    <p>While these Cards aren&#8217;t exactly the Ideal Solution as long as they&#8217;re not Banned they will always be a viable Fallback Method for any Vendor planning to Cash out Bitcoin into Fiat Money. There are other Polish Banks like for example iBRE but this thread will detail only those of Bank Zachodni WBK as they&#8217;re vastly Cheaper and more popular in Comparison. Eventually this Method will very likely be Phased Out in favor of Better Alternatives, but until that Day this Information might prove Useful for Upcoming Vendors who aren&#8217;t that familiar with Methods of Cashing Out Bitcoins.</p>
