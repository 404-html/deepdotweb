    <p><strong>Update 6 &#8211; 30.11.14 &#8211; </strong>Multiple reports are claiming that the issues are fixed now!</p>
    <p><strong>Update 5 &#8211; 29.11.14 &#8211; </strong>Agora is still experiencing significant delays in deposits, but withdrawals are now working fine.</p>
    <p><strong>Update 4 &#8211; 26.11.14:</strong> Update from <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/agora-market">Agora</a> posted as a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AgMarketplace/comments/2nfce2/a_message_from_agora_in_regards_to_delays/">reply</a> to a PM:</p>
    <div class="usertext-body may-blank-within">
    <div class="md">
    <blockquote><p>There has been a growing backlog of transactions as people rush to withdraw (understandably). We are expected the backlog to clear within the next 24 hours. Apologies for the delays.</p>
    <p>These delays are not specific to individual accounts and we cannot expedite individual requests. This is a site wide issue and the backlog is clearing as quickly as possible.</p></blockquote>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Update 3</strong> &#8211; 26.11.14: Deposits &amp; Withdrawals Are Broken again &#8211; Do not deposit until its sorted!</span></p>
    <p><strong>Update 2</strong>: The issue has been resolved, deposits and withdrawals are functional again. There are still delays, but deposits and withdrawals are getting to their destinations. Agora administrators have proven themselves once again.</p>

    <p><strong>Update</strong>: An account that was previously confirmed as an official Agora administrator posted this update earlier on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2n60qo/agora_withdrawals_will_be_restored_within_the_day/">Reddit</a> (we added the link to Agora&#8217;s Availability FAQ page for those who are not familiar with it):</p>
    <div class="usertext-body may-blank-within">
    <div class="md">
    <blockquote><p>Dear users, we are sorry again for the lack of communication. The current problems are a direct result of our security model, even though at this time it was unfortunate that many of you had to wait for your money because of this. As our <a title="Agora Admin Explains: Why is Agora Always down?" href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/09/01/agora-admin-explains-why-is-agora-always-down/">Availability FAQ</a> has stated, we always value security above availability and feel this is the only way to run an operation like ours. We believe this is also on of the reasons we were one of the few to withstand the test of time and seizures. The outstanding withdrawals should be complete during the day. For future withdrawals expect some minor delays in the order of a couple of hours between the adding of payout and the transaction broadcasting, until the problem is completely resolved in the middle of next week. The forums might take a couple of days as well, we are putting all our resources on solving the payment issues.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Unlike previous messages from this account, this message was not PGP signed. However, the same account has posted signed messages from Agora administrators in the past, so it is likely that this message is legitimate.  Regardless, we advise that users avoid making deposits until everything is back to normal.</p>

    <p>In the past 36 hours there have been a very large number of reports <strong>confirming</strong> that deposits and withdrawals are not working on the Agora dark net market, which is currently the largest dark net market. Agora has suffered several <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/03/10/what-to-do-while-your-favorite-market-is-under-attack-agora/">Attacks</a> in the past, as well as several technical issues (example:<a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/07/30/agora-2/">#1</a>, <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/12/agora-marketplace-changes-url-due-heartbleed-ssl-bug/">#2</a>) which caused lengthy downtimes, as well as some issues that disabled deposits and withdrawals [<a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/04/warning-agora-deposits-withrawls-not-working/">#1</a>, <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/16/warningagora-warning-error-could-not-withdraw/">#2</a>]. These past issues were resolved in due time, so it is hard to determine if the current problems are the start of another <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/11/30/sheep-marketplace-scammed-over-40000000-in-the-biggets-darknet-scam-ever/">large exit scam</a> or if they are a technical issue. In addition to the problem concerning deposits and withdrawals, it seems as if Agora&#8217;s forums are down as well.</p>
    <p>Users are reporting that both deposits and withdrawals are not being processed by the dark net market and that transactions are not being broadcast on the blockchain once a deposits or withdrawal has been initiated.</p>
    <p>Here is a sample that someone sent us showing the log of these transactions on the market:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/agoratrans.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8391" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/agoratrans.png" alt="agoratrans" width="964" height="269" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/agoratrans.png 964w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/agoratrans-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 964px) 100vw, 964px"/></a>During this time, and like with previous issues that occurred on Agora, the admins posted a sitewide warning, stating:</p>
    <blockquote><p>We are aware of the payment issues, working on the solution.</p></blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/aware.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8392" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/aware.png" alt="aware" width="550" height="82" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/aware.png 550w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/aware-300x45.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"/></a></p>
    <p>The same notice was given in a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AgMarketplace/comments/2n2qbg/deposit_withdrawal_issues_day_ii/">Reddit thread</a> concerning the issue:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/support.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-8409" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/support.jpg" alt="support" width="464" height="235" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/support.jpg 1920w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/support-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/support-1024x518.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px"/></a></p>
    <p>It is needless to say that, due to the past experiences we have had with similar situations on various dark net markets. <strong>No one should deposit any funds with Agora until the issues have been resolved</strong>. DeepDotWeb will continue to follow the story and provide any updates if needed. An active warning has been added to the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/dark-net-market-comparison-chart/">markets chart</a> and <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/agora-market">Agora’s listing</a>.</p>
