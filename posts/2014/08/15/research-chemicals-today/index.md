    <p>I&#8217;ve been involved in the research chemical scene for a long time now and over the years I&#8217;ve ingested many, many substances to extrapolate their effects. This is all research to figure out the Structure Activity Relationships (SAR) between different compounds. Basically what compounds hit which receptors and what happens after that. On my journey I&#8217;ve been as far as one can go in terms of “highness”!</p>
    <p>However the research chemical scene today is dwindling. It&#8217;s still producing many novel compounds to bypass laws but only in the most popular areas, which seem to be the empathogens, stimulants and cannabinoids. We have 5-EAPB, a-PVP, MPA and numerous cannabinoids which seem to pop up faster than you can even fully understand the last. My favourites of the cannabinoids have to be the cannabinoid re-uptake inhibitors such as LY-2183240. These compounds don&#8217;t actually agonise your cannabinoid receptors as Cannabis and other cannabinoids do but they enhance your own endogenous cannabinoids, so essentially you&#8217;re getting high off your own juices! Then when these are combined with agonists such as THC or other synthetic cannabinoids, they enhance the high to such an extent that a gram of weed could last you a week with say 20mg of the CRI&#8217;s! Now <em>that</em> is innovation.</p>
    <p>I&#8217;m not here to talk to you about cannabinoids though. What is really on my agenda is the lack of innovation in the psychedelic realm. PIHKAL and TIHKAL have offered us hundreds of compounds that could be made yet only the most basic are marketed. Now to me this is a problem. I <em>love</em> novel psychedelics. In fact I could name a few that I made up here and now (i.e. 2C-MAL, 4-Bromo-Mescaline, 4-PropO-PiPT etc.).</p>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that no-one is producing novel psychedelics anymore. There have been a few in the last couple of years that were great such as 3C-E and bk-2C-B but apart from those (rather meagre) psychedelics, there has been no big bangs, which is what I love. The compounds that could be a big hit are: 5-TOET, ALEPH &amp; ALEPH-2, 2C-EF, 2C-TFM, CPM, 2C-T-21, DMMDA, psi-DOx (these have lowered duration for those who aren&#8217;t fans of long psychedelics), MEM, MMDA-2, MMDA-3a (and it&#8217;s methyl analogue), MMDA itself (capable of producing &#8216;brain movies&#8217;) and a whole host of other analogues for instance 2C-C-FLY.</p>
    <p>I have to give praise to some that are producing such compounds though as DON, DOET, LSZ, AL-LAD and 2C-B-FLY have made it onto the scene recently.</p>
    <p>However my main message in this is that as darknets are expanding, the need for analogues and research chemicals has become redundant. People would rather get a gram of MDMA than a gram of MDE or DMMDA. They&#8217;d rather get some 2C-B than some 2C-T-16 or 2C-YN. The research chemical scene used to be thriving and everyone wanted to make their mark on the world. Just look at how well MXE has done, and this is not even close to what could be. With a little imagination and drive, even better compounds could be created. They also need to be distributed at the retail end as there are many wholesalers who do produce fantastic products but customers are so dead set on what they know and want there is no room for expansion.</p>
    <p>If we are to evolve chemically we must start to abandon the basic drugs we know and love. It&#8217;s a risky venture, of course, but those who use drugs engage in risky behaviour all the time, why not expand those boundaries to let in some of the fantastic compounds that are out there waiting to be synthesized? This is evolution at it&#8217;s most basic definition and with the introduction of Black Marketplaces it seems we are at a lull, we are not striving to the future but perhaps, someday, we&#8217;ll wake up and realise that the compounds many have neglected are the ones that they want the most.</p>
    <p>I&#8217;ll leave you with this link: <a href="http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/95736-5-Methyl-MDA-First-time-Craaaaaaazzzy">http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/95736-5-Methyl-MDA-First-time-Craaaaaaazzzy</a></p>
    <p>I should mention the compound in question was <strong><em>not</em></strong> 5-Methyl-MDA but I think it could have been MMDA-3a with a methyl group instead of a methoxy. Basically they got the wrong side and 5-MMDA turned out to be quite poor. However if some bright spark should put that methyl on the top of the molecule then we&#8217;ll probably see something similar to this compound.</p>
    <p>So do some research, have a read of PIHKAL and TIHKAL, find some compounds that look fun and exciting, and post your interest in the appropriate place (Darknet Marketplace forums, RC companies&#8217; &#8216;contact us&#8217; page, bluelight and other drug forums, reddit, 420Chan, basically anywhere that has a common interest in these compounds).</p>
    <p>Let&#8217;s get that Psychedelic RC Train going again!</p>
