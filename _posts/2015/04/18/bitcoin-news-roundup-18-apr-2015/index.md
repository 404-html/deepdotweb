<p><em>Recapping the week&#8217;s biggest Bitcoins stories from around the web. </em></p>
<p>British authorities are in favor of the digital currency in view of upgrading the current financial system. As Sarah Jenn of <a href="http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/04/16/can-london-be-a-global-bitcoin-hub/">NewsBtc</a> writes, in spite of the UK government’s intention to regulate the bitcoin, there are bitcoin devotees, who would love to see London becoming a bitcoin hub. In this context, suggested regulations should be formulated with an aim to avert the use of the digital currency in fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Child pornography becomes the focus of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF). As Maria Santos of <a href="http://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-exchanges-internet-watch-foundation-combat-child-pornography/">99bitcoins</a> writes, numerous child sexual abuse websites accept the digital currency as a legal form of payment. IWF seeks to work closely with major bitcoin exchanges around the globe in order to implement strategies against sexual child abuse and prevent the use of the bitcoin for the circulation of sexual child abusematerial online.</p>
<p>Major U.S. charities are accepting contributions in bitcoins due to lower transaction costs.

This is expected to spread the use of the bitcoin further.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation</strong></p>
