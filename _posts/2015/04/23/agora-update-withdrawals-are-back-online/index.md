    <p>The most recent update from Agora admins:</p>
    <blockquote><p><span class="market-wide-message">Withdrawals are back online. Since many online services may not accept payments that are coming in too late, we have cancelled such delayed requests, and in that case you might need to schedule the withdrawal again on the wallet page (it should be back in your balance).</span></p></blockquote>
