<p><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/73162685/judge-warns-dark-web-fraudster-to-expect-prison-if-he-offends-again.html">Timothy Bourke (23) who has spent around $6000 from a stolen credit card he obtained from the dark web, has been warned by the judge to expect prison time if he offends again.</a> The carder was sentenced in the Nelson District Court on Monday on counts of accessing a computer system for dishonesty and one charge of intending to access a computer system for dishonesty.</p>
<p>Bourke has previously used <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/evolution/">Evolution</a> (before it was closed down in an exit scam), to purchase the credit card details he used for carding. The man used these details to make around 10 online purchases totaling the sum of $6742.67. He made the purchases between September 1 and October 15 last year. According to law enforcement authorities, he has used his own personal computer for the purchases. He used online stores for carding, including Countdown, Hallensteins, The Warehouse, Domino&#8217;s Pizza, Mitre 10, Wild Pair, Macpac and Sony. The list of things he bought from these shops are gardening items, a television, shoes, tramping boots, clothing, food, pizza, video games and DVDs.</p>
<p>Bourke has told the police (after he has been caught) that he didn’t think those items would be delivered. He also stated that felt guilty when the items have arrived and decided to donate most of the carded items to the Nelson Refuse Centre. Michael Vesty, representing the defense in the case has told the judge that Bourke was &#8220;upfront and honest&#8221; with law enforcement authorities and he provided all the required information regarding the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Police knew about a couple (of the offenses) but he volunteered another seven,” Vesty said.</p>
<p>He also stated that Bourke’s mental health issues were the major causes of the crime. According to Vesty, Bourke has made rearrangements to borrow money and pay back the victim within 7 days.</p>
<p>Judge Richard Russell stated that Bourke had convictions for similar offending in 2010 and 2013. His pre-sentence report said he showed genuine remorse and his risk of re-offending was medium to low. According to Judge Richard Russel, Bourke has gone through a difficult time emotionally and his offending had become an addiction. The judge made this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;The offending here has to be viewed seriously. The use of the internet these days is an integral way people buy and sell goods and retailers are entitled to expect that people who order property online pay for it. The whole system really breaks down if people like you come into play and order goods and don&#8217;t pay for it. I think you knew what you were doing is wrong, but you did it anyway, you did it on 10 separate occasions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bourke was sentenced to 130 hours of community work, $6742.67 reparation paid to the victim and six months supervision with conditions to complete recommended alcohol and drug assessments, counselling and treatment.</p>
<p>“You be warned, Mr Bourke,&#8221; Judge Richard Russell said. &#8220;You come back to court again for a fourth time on similar charge &#8230; a sentence of imprisonment is right on the cards for you.&#8221;</p>
