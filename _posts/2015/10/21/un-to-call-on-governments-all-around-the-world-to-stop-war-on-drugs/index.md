<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/united-nations-to-urge-governments-to-decriminalise-drugs-richard-bransons-claims-in-full-a6700371.html">Branson has made an extraordinary post on his Virgin website</a> stating that he had shown an official report by the UNODC (UN Office on Drugs and Crime). According to the businessman, this report has dramatically changed the UN’s stance on drug control.</p>
<p>According to Richard Branson, the report has been sent to ”some of the world’s media under embargo”. Branson stated that the United Nations were planning to release the statement, however, he has gone public before them since he feared that the UN will &#8220;bow to pressure by not going ahead with this important move&#8221;. Branson wrote that the UN was preparing to declare &#8220;unequivocally that criminalization is harmful unnecessary and disproportionate&#8221;. He also stated that the new stance of UN on the war on drugs were supposed to be released at a conference in Malaysia this Sunday, however, it has been delayed by the organization.</p>
<p>The original statement of Branson goes by:</p>
<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;m writing this I am hearing that at least one government is putting an inordinate amount of pressure on the UNODC. Let us hope the UNODC, a global organization that is part of the UN and supposed to do what is right for the people of the world, does not do a remarkable volte-face at the last possible moment and bow to pressure by not going ahead with this important move. The war on drugs has done too much damage to too many people already.&#8221;</p>
