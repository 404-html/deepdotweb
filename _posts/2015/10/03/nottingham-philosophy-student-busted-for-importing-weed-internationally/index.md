<p><a href="http://www.nottinghampost.com/Nottingham-philosophy-student-caught-importing/story-27890513-detail/story.html">Benjamin Koops, a student studying philosophy at the University of Nottingham, has been busted for importing weed from the US.</a> The student has ordered the cannabis from DNMs, however, two of the packages have been intercepted by the National Crime Agency (NCA). According to the LE, the packages have been caught and been traced back to Koops. This could mean that the NCA or the local police has performed a controlled delivery on the philosophy student, this information is not confirmed, though.</p>
<p>Koops pleaded guilty to supplying cannabis and to two charges of fraudulent evasion of prohibition regarding the importation of weed.</p>
<p>The student got a pretty harsh sentence for his acts. According to LE, he imported a total of 100 grams of weed (that has been intercepted). Benjamin Koops’ sentence goes by 12 months in prison, suspended for two years from the University of Nottingham, a 20-day rehabilitation activity requirement, 250 hours of unpaid work and the sum of £800 as a payment.</p>
<p>According to Judge James Sampson, Koops is a well-educated man who is in his final year before getting his degree from philosophy. The student is also coming from a middle-class family with a good background. Judge James Sampson has made some statements regarding the case, which could hardly be commented:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you sat in this court on a regular basis you would see a procession of unfortunate people coming through that door most of whom would be cannabis addicts.”</p>
<p>&#8220;They suffer from cannabis-infused psychosis and various other mental health problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;They commit crimes to fund their cannabis and other habits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their families are fractured and devastated by their addiction and it is the likes of you who peddle such misery in cities such as this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutor Sarah Munro has commented Koops’ acts by that the philosophy student has admitted that he was importing cannabis and the fact that he has supplied his friends from the shipments. According to LE, he made a total profit of £3,570 and had £1,920 available at the time he was arrested.</p>
<p>Matthew Smith, to mitigate Koops’ situation, he stated that this has been a naive enterprise to support the costs of his grammar school and university.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is abundantly clear from the pre-sentence report he did not fully appreciate the significance of his activities.”</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not appreciate he was importing the drug or the extent of his criminality. He did not see himself as a dealer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His family are exceptionally concerned about him today,&#8221; he stated.</p>
