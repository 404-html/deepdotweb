<p><a href="http://www.middevongazette.co.uk/Dark-web-user-jailed-luring-girls-online/story-27998173-detail/story.html">Joel Morter (25) has been jailed for using dark web CP (child porn) websites for exchanging under-aged sex media and for making under-aged girls strip off naked in front of a webcam.</a></p>
<p>When police have raided Morter’s house they found him at his computer reading child abuse stories online. Law enforcement authorities have found 919 child porn related content, including 274 movies that contained the abuse of children, some of them were categorized as &#8220;one of the most extreme types of child porn&#8221;. He has been sharing some of these videos and movies on unnamed dark web pedo sites. The police also found chat logs of Morter contacting with young girls from all over the world.</p>
<p>The chat messages were found on the child porn abuser’s laptop and iPhone, according to law enforcement authorities, he was messaging those children and was trying to make them upload naked pictures of themselves. He once told a 14-year old girl: &#8220;Age does not matter. I like young girls and you are gorgeous.&#8221; According to law enforcement authorities, the precise number of children he has contacted with is 24, among those children the youngest is 10 years old. Some of the potential victims had been sent an image purporting to be his private parts without warning.</p>
<p>Joel Morter has pleaded guilty to seven charges of making, five of distributing CP images, and two of attempting to incite children to watch or be involved child pornography. He was jailed for 30 months by Judge Erik Salomonsen. The judge ordered Morter to sign the sex offenders’ register for life and made him subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order, which will allow law enforcement authorities to monitor the man’s internet use.</p>
<p>Judge Erik Salomonsen has told Morter:</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been said on your behalf that your crimes did not involve physical contact with children and were carried out over the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a fact of modern life that many children access the internet and are exposed to the activities of other individuals much older than themselves who seek to contact them for their own sexual pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;This may not involve physical contact, but you were in touch and wished to be in touch with real children and it is not too extreme to use the word corruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;The totality of your offending, particularly the extensive distribution and your activities or attempted activities with children must be met by immediate custody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Caroline Bolt from prosecution stated that Morter was found in the United States and was identified by the police from images that has been founded during the police raid on his home in Exminster back in May, last year. Prosecutor Bolt has made this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;He also sought or received images from people purporting to be children and analysis of his history showed he had been using the so-called dark web.&#8221;</p>
<p>Philip Brunt from defending stated Morter had suffered sexual abuse in the past, which caused him depression and led him to drink and engage in disinhibited behavior with children.</p>
<p>He is now tackling his problems and is working with the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, which helps users of internet pornography change their behavior.</p>
