<p>New update from Agora after the recent issues with the <a title="Permalink to Warning: New Malicious JS Using CSRF exploit via PM’s On Agora" href="
/2015/06/11/warning-new-malicious-js-using-csrf-exploit-via-pms-on-agora/" rel="bookmark">Malicious JS Using CSRF exploit via PM’s On Agora</a> And their second update &#8220;<a class="post-title" title="Permanent link to Agora: We Are Working On A Solution For The CSRF Issue" href="

<blockquote><p><span class="market-wide-message">It should be more safe to use JavaScript in the browser on Agora again. However it is generally advisable to turn JavaScript off if you do anything sensitive on the web, especially since Agora website does not require JavaScript for anything.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>From reading this update its not fully clear if the CSRF issue was 100% fixed or not, But it doesn&#8217;t matter so much because <strong>no one should enable scripts anyway</strong>,  not on Aogra on anywhere else using Tor, thats all.</p>
