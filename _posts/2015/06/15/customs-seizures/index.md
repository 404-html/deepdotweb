    <p>Looking through the public notice of <a href="http://www.forfeiture.gov/pdf/CBP/OfficialNotification.pdf" target="_blank">Customs seizures</a>, there is something rather strange:</p>
    <p>Scroll to page 565- there is a seizure for a number of gold tokens marked &#8220;Bitcoin&#8221;. All circumstances seem to support that these coins were most likely <em>novelty coins.</em> Just search Google for “novelty gold bitcoin”, many items come up, supplied mainly from China. In all probability these are the exact items that were seized. The value of these coins is intrinsic to the materials that they are made from, namely a base metal plated in gold.</p>
    <p>“2015330700002101-007-0000, Seized on 10/14/2014; At the port of DENVER, CO; 76 GOLD COLORED TOKENS</p>
    <p>MARKED &#8220;BITCOIN&#8221;; 76; EA; Valued at $30,804.32;:</p>
    <p>The government has valued these novelty bitcoins as having a value approximately equal to the current value actual of BTC; nowhere near the real value of the novelty coins, which is about a dollar each. For all intents and purposes, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that these coins are novelties and not backed by any<em> actual</em> BTC value. It is illogical to send physical BTC through the mail when it is far easier to send them through the blockchain, the way they were intended.</p>
    <p>The coins were seized under the federal code 18USC981(A)(1)(A), 18USC1960 These are civil asset seizure statues which pertain specifically to <em>money laundering</em>.</p>
    [<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/981%20" target="_blank">18 USC 981</a>]
    <p><strong>“(1) The following property is subject to forfeiture to the United States:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>(A) Any property, real or personal, involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of section 1956, 1957 or 1960 of this title, or any property traceable to such property.”</strong></p>
    [<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956" target="_blank">section 1956</a>]
    <p><strong>“</strong><strong>(a)</strong><strong>(1)</strong><strong> Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity”</strong></p>
    [<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956" target="_blank">section 1957</a>]
    <p><strong>“(a)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Whoever, in any of the circumstances set forth in subsection (d), knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000…”</strong></p>
    [<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1960" target="_blank">section 1960</a>]
    <p><strong>“(a)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Whoever knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business, shall be fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.”</strong></p>
    <p>It is intriguing that Customs and Border Control views Bitcoin as directly relating to money laundering when in reality there is little to no possibility that the federal government could have any knowledge of the source of the alleged bitcoins, or taking account that the chances that the seized items are backed by any cryptocurrency at all is effectively nil. Customs has simply applied the current bitcoin value to the seized property, without any regard for the possibility that these coins were not backed by any actual cryptocurrency and were in all likelihood just novelty coins for the purpose of just that, novelty.</p>
    <p>While it is possible that this was merely a mistake on part of Customs, it is very likely that this speaks to the government’s larger view towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. There may well have been a directive issued to Customs agents to be on the lookout for items related to Bitcoins. Regardless of the underlying intentions, the situation and circumstances make it quite clear that the government views Bitcoins as a device of money laundering. They are willing to seize Bitcoins as evidence of money laundering when they have no evidence to support that that crime ever even took place, this alone is enough to assume something much larger may be at play.</p>
    <p>As the internet community is well aware, there are a multitude of legitimate uses of Bitcoin. People use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services which are completely legal. There are businesses that allow payment in Bitcoin because they are unable or unwilling to access traditional banks and payment processors. WikiLeaks, for example, was forced to accept donation via Bitcoin when credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard, along with payment processor Paypal, shutout their organization based on a disagreement with their ideology. It is ludicrous assume that <em>novelty</em> bitcoins are being used expressly for the purpose of money laundering without any consideration that it makes little to no sense that a would be money launderer would transport illicitly obtained property through an international postal services which takes weeks, while it is perfectly capable of being transmitted through the internet in mere minutes, without the risk of interception by Customs agents.</p>
    <p>At best, this situation was a mistake, at worst; it indicates that the United States government is taking an ever icier view toward cryptocurrency. The official statement by customs is that these bitcoins have been seized as evidence of money laundering, but a far more probable reason is that they are attempting to regulate this virtually unregulatable currency. This should be taken at face value; we will continue to monitor Customs notifications for any continued seizures of physical Bitcoins.</p>
