    <p>FALL RIVER — An alleged scheme to ship narcotics from Puerto Rico to Fall River using the U.S. Postal Service ended in two men arrested on trafficking charges and a kilogram of cocaine seized.</p>
    <p>Authorities say using fictitious names or addresses on postal parcels is a common tactic by drug distributors in Puerto Rico to ship controlled substances to New England. Investigators became suspicious when a package arrived last Friday at the post office at Government Center with destination and sender addresses that did not match the names of people associated with those addresses in public records.</p></blockquote>
