<p>Two minor site updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Onion URL was added to the logo &#8211; for better visibility and for anyone to compare when suspecting cloning / phishing attempt (<a href="/2015/06/18/reminder-this-is-our-only-legit-onion-address-deepdot35wvmeyd5-onion/">that should not happen anyway</a>).</li>
<li>Added a clickable link to change to the Onion site while browsing the site on Tor, the link is located on the right end corner of the top navigation bar.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are happy to see that the onion address is being used, hoping to see it being used even more. Please contact us if you encounter any issue.</p>
