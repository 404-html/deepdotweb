    <p>Written by ACE from <strong>TheScurvyCrew</strong> and published to his request, one of the oldest Dark net markets vendors since Silk Road 1 days, Here is a <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-scurvy-crew-silk-road-interview">Vice article</a> published about them last year that can give some background, and some background about the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/252z99/ace_has_doxxed_a_the_user_who_posted_about_a/">doxxing incident</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Its Been An Amazing Ride:</em></p>
    <p>You may not know us, but we are a large seller that started up in the early days of SR1. We will be winding down operations soon due to a number of reasons, but I thought you might be interested in hearing out story in much the same way as you put forward Mr.Nice Guys mistakes in the past and gave him a platform to mediate on.</p>
    <p>We were banned form agora a time ago for the supposed DOXXING of a customer, this is false and you can read back through the agora forums to see the truth.<br />
    What did happen however was that I did have a pizza sent to her house and paid for, and I did warn her that if she didn&#8217;t stop harassing us that I did have her address and did threaten in a joking way that I would send a kilo of crack to her house..  I would have assumed that most people would have realized this to be a joke considering the price of crack these days but hey&#8230; I like to play jokes and its my way of dealing with people that really stressed me out.</p>
    <p>It was tit for tat, that perhaps I should not have got involved in, but it was done deliberately to harm my business. The girl/Boy posted over 22 posts a day just bashing us on our thread, she had never placed an order with us, she had never even had any contact with us, it was just scammer this scammer that, the products are shit. And that hurts you know when every gram of opium takes you a long time to collect dragging yourself across a dusty floor with armed security guards at every entrance. I tried reasoning with her, but she just ignored her message, so the final straw for me and for her was that I posted a message with the first initials of her first name and the fist letters of the city and everything else dotted out.. As far as I am aware to DOXX someone you need to give enough information to be able to identify that person, we never even gave out her name. But anyway what passed is passed. It hurt me a lot, and I spent a long time trying to find out if it was a competitor or just someone with mental issues. However this happened almost a year ago and we are still known as the people that doxxed that girl and got banned from agora.</p>
    <p>The only other gripe people have with us, is that at the end of SR2 I got sick and packages were delayed. SR turned into an LE show anyway and shut down, but we ensured that every delayed package apart from two that I considered scammers *out of *700 packs reached the customers, however because the forums cut out when they did people saw that packs were arriving but never got to see that they had all arrived by the end, even people that contacted me on other sites after SR2 I attended to and reshipped or refunded *nucleus, Dreams etc, and I have proof and they even posted it on the forums. But when the crowd goes one way it takes a lot of courage for an individual to go another way so I don&#8217;t blame them. So we&#8217;ve kinda been stuck with a label that hurts too much to keep.</p>
    <p>I invested everything in this game, my freedom, my house my money. I was in semi constant communication with Ross and actually spoke to him the day he was arrested, I was a part of the community that helped make SR1 the community that it was. We all make mistakes on the way, and learn from them, but on every market that we have been a part of excluding the last 2 months of SR2 we have always had a rating in the high 90%s, with excellent feedback and thousands and thousands of sales. And an even bigger following.<br />
    We still get a huge amount of sales, more in fact that from SR1 and BMR combined, but I don&#8217;t want to carry on doing this having to face the same shit every day. I felt after a few months it would blow over.</p>
    <p>What makes me angry is what Ive put into this revolution. Im a big part of the bitcoin community now promoting bitcoin cash machines around Europe. I advocate for a global free market economy. And most importantly I believe that what nature gives no man has the right to take away. I believe in peoples right to chose and in the freedom of every person on this planet, be it the freedom to love, or to explore their own mind through LSD or to cure their own pain using opium or heroin.</p>
    <p>What hurts is that when vendors were in trouble we were the first to offer safe houses to vendors that were in trouble, in fact one of those vendors turned into one of our best resellers, we provided them papers out of the country, a house, packaging equipment and stock so they could get on their feet, also another vendor just needed extraction and transport.<br />
    Weve loaned many people money, as well as had loans given to us and paid back in full.</p>
    <p>People see us as this negative entity simply because of what happened in the last months of SR2 and theyre bitter that the site shut down  and they never got to hear that the packs were returned, there is only 1 outstanding pack of heroin and we are on our 4 reship now and I think he might be scamming us. Just 3 months before the SR2 shutdown everyone was singing our praises and saying how exemplary we are, and now that the newbies have come in and only heard half of the story they have no problem calling us scammers and doxxers on the forums, which is simply not true.</p>
    <p>Im not saying this for any other reason than im sad it happened and I hope that people will learn to be kinder with their words, in SR we all had a spirit of community, we all cared for each other and regularly juked around on the forums and chat rooms and had a great relationship, now its turned into something nasty, Ive seen people post that they don&#8217;t care if a vendor loses money because were just like corporations, another time we had 4 purchases of our least expensive product just so they could get a reship and they leave an awful review, they posted they would do it on the forums the day before. This isnt the revolution I signed up for, and I don&#8217;t want the money from it either. I think Ill go my own way and find something to do that is more in line with my values like bitcoin trading, a universal deregulated monetary system is what we fought for in the first place.</p>
    <p>A bunch of kids looking for weed is not. So yeah we will be winding down operation over the next few months and selling the stock we have left, we will probably do a clearance sale soon just to get rid of the last bits, and anything left over we will hand out to our network of resellers.</p>
    <p>If I had one message to you all it would be to love each other, and realize that vendor and customer are just the same, we are all people trying to make a living, because we have access to the drugs that you want does not make us bad people, in our case to get those drugs to you ive personally had to eat 900g of hash eggs and drive across a boarder, or take a dangerous route across the sahara, Once I nearly died and had to be narcaned testing anew batch of H. its very very far from easy money, but at the same time, im not the kinda person who wants to spend <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1880802569"><span class="aQJ">8 to 6pm</span></span> working in a cubicle to make another man rich. I have my own dreams as should all of you. I don&#8217;t believe in the world in the way it is, simply because the people running it have been proven liars. And in our hands now we hold the key to a new world a better world, and that key is bitcoin and all that may come of it.</p>
    <p>So yeah, When you think back to The Scurvy Crew why not think of the 5 and a half years of excellent sales, us posting our stories on how we got that particular batch, the competitions we used to run on the forum, it brings a smile to my face whenever I read that our forum was the most visited on SR1, and the people we helped. We still have the charity list if anyone can find it.<br />
    We will be doing a few giveaways, but only really for people that knew us from before, I haven&#8217;t really fallen in love with the new generation of tor users.. No offense, but form the outside with all the flaming and the insults and the trying to be cleverer than everyone else.. it just doesn&#8217;t sit right with me, there will always be someone who knows more and always be someone who knows less.<br />
    Anyway, I hope you find a good source of opium and hash in the future but nothing beats the good old Bayer grown goodness!</p>
    <p><em>Anyway enough of your time. T.S.C will be no more as soon as we clear the current stock, shipping times are back to normal and if I reduce prices I think we can clear all the stock pretty quick, we have a network of resellers at the moment so I&#8217;m nor sure at the moment what will happen there, they sell their own products too and as I understand it will be adding more products also.</em></p>
    <p>So sorry for the wall of text<br />
    ACE<br />
    NAMASTE</p>
