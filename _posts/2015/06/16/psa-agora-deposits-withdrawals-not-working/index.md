    <p><strong>Update: <span style="color: #ff0000;">The issue is confirmed as resolved &#8211; payments are working fine!</span></strong></p>
    <p>As of earlier today we have received multiple reports that Deposits &amp; Withdrawals are not working  on Agora marketplace, we were able to confirm these reports. As we have seen <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/agora/">many times before</a> with Payment issues on Agora, they will most likely be sorted later rather than sooner, but as always its advised to avoid sending any money to the market until this type of issues are confirmed as resolved, will follow up and post updated when we  hear something new.</p>
