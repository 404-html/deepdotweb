<p>We have been seeing some attempts to clone our onion address using similar URLS and displaying the site&#8217;s content but changing all market URLS to <strong>phishing urls</strong> (in short &#8211; <a href="/2015/04/22/reminder-onion-cloner-phishing-scams/">onion cloner</a> scam)</p>
<p>We have managed to break these clone sites and anyone who will access them will just get a blank page, and if he has JS enabled he will be redirected to the real url: <strong>deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to use only this url to access DeepDotWeb via onion address: <strong>deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use any links to ANY site from the hidden wiki or other directories!</li>
<li>If you see other Onion clone sites that are not broken, please <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</li>
<li>Our readers safety is a top priority. So please let us know if you encounter any other attempt to clone / scrape DeepDotWeb&#8217;s content.</li>
</ul>
