<p>Despite the recent massive FUD &amp; Ddos attacks on the market, <a href="#">Alphabay</a> admins showed no sign of slowing down and released some other new &amp; unique features:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have now added support for Paid Advertisement via <b>Sticky Listings</b> &amp; <b>Sticky Topics</b>. The perfect opportunity for both new &amp; old vendors to promote their products &amp; services.</p>
<p><b>Sticky Listings &#8211; In Marketplace:</b><br/>

<p>Also, as requested by users, the User Feedback page will now display the last 5 feedback (regardless of the type), to make buyers see more easily if the seller had recent problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>AlphaBay Administration told us via PM on the market that:</p>
<blockquote><p>New capabilities (e.g. paid listing bidding) are in the works, expanding the newly-introduced advertisement features to a whole new level where no other marketplace has been to.</p></blockquote>
