As Maria Santos of <a href="http://99bitcoins.com/coinbase-suspends-bitcoin-services-wyoming-banking-regulation/">99bitcoins</a> writes, the San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet is not satisfied with the current regulatory policies in the Wyoming Division of Banking as they may <em>“render continued operations impractical.”</em>According to the company’s announcement<em> “Although Coinbase securely maintains 100% of all customer Bitcoin, it is impractical, costly, and inefficient for us to establish a redundant reserve of fiat currency in equivalent value.”</em></p>
