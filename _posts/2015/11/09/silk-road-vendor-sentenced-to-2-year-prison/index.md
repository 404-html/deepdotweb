<p><a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/silk-road-vendor-sentenced-two-years-prison">Sheldon Kennedy (25) from Lincoln, Nebraska, has been sentenced for 2 years of prison, which is followed by 3 years of supervised release for conspiracy to traffic in controlled substances, including cocaine and many other illegal substances.</a> Kennedy sold drugs, counterfeit money and lethal weapons online on the infamous former Silk Road Marketplace.</p>
<p>According to Kennedy’s plea, he sold the drugs under his username (not known publicly) and sent the drugs to his customer using the United States Postal Service. In 2012, federal agents have made plenty of undercover purchases from Kennedy. The agents have bought drugs several times and once a Glock 26 handgun from the Silk Road vendor. According to the federal agents, Kennedy has disassembled the weapon in two pieces and sent it in 2 shipments in order to avoid detection. Both shipments were made from Nebraska to an undercover mailbox in Maryland.</p>
<p>On June 28, 2013, a federal search warrant was executed at Kennedy’s house in Lincoln, Nebraska. The vendor was at home when the feds have arrived at his place and he agreed to speak with the law enforcement authorities. Kennedy admitted that he used an online username for the sale of drugs, guns, and counterfeit currency on Silk Road, including cocaine, LSD, and several other synthetic and controlled prescription substances. He also admitted that the chemicals and laboratory equipment in his residence were used to manufacture Phenazepam, a controlled substance. During the time when the warrant was executed, the agents recovered ten firearms and various drugs, including Barbital powder, Phenazepam, Ethylphenidate, Ketamine, Etaqualone, Xanax, Valium, and Heroin. Kennedy also admitted selling at least 38 grams of cocaine.</p>
<p>The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge Andre Watson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); Assistant Special Agent in Charge Don A. Hibbert of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Baltimore District Office; Postal Inspector in Charge David G. Bowers of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service &#8211; Washington Division; Special Agent in Charge William P. McMullan of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives &#8211; Baltimore Field Division; Special Agent in Charge Brian Murphy of the United States Secret Service &#8211; Baltimore Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge Thomas Jankowski of the Internal Revenue Service &#8211; Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C.
