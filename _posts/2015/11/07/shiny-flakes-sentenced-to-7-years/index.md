    <p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/shiny-flakes-prozess-sieben-jahre-haft-fuer-kinderzimmer-dealer-a-1060740.html">On Monday, Maximilian S. AKA Shiny Flakes, the 20 years old dark web dealer, has been sentenced for 7 years of youth sentence in prison for illegally trafficking drugs in large quantities by the Leipzig District Court.</a></p>
    <p>Norbert Göbel, the judge of the case has said that the act Maximilian S. was doing was highly criminal activity and has involved almost a ton of illegal drugs. In the Shiny Flakes case, the prosecution has asked the judge for 8 years and 8 months in prison, however, Maximilian S. plead guilty and got 6 years and 6 month in juvenile prison.</p>
    <p>Maximilian S. AKA <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/shiny/">Shiny Flakes</a> has been caught by the local law enforcement authorities during a police raid where the officers have found 300 kg of drugs, including hash, LSD, cocaine prescription pills and MDMA. According to court documents and law enforcement authorities, Maximilian has sold the drugs on dark net marketplaces under the username ”Shiny Flakes”. Later, he stopped his dark web business and sold the illegal substances on the clearnet. About his clearnet deals, it is estimated that he sold drugs worth around 4 million Euros. Police has found ”only” 300 kg of drugs at Maximilian’s house, however, it became clear that the young vendor has sold around 914 kg of drugs over the internet.</p>
    <p>After Shiny Flakes has been arrested in February, he confessed how he made the money, how he ran the business, literally everything. According to him, he did not do this kind of business on the internet primarily to gain money, but to outdo his competitors.</p>
