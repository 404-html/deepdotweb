<p><a href="http://www.9news.com.au/national/2015/11/10/11/21/new-qld-child-safety-taskforce-set-up">Taskforce Orion, Queensland’s new task force will become a specialist branch of Taskforce Argos, which considers its main priority to hunt down pedophiles on the dark net</a>. Commissioner Ian Stewart states that TaskForce Orion’s workforce will consist of a total of 6 specialist members. They will focus on the highest-level pedophiles who are hosting websites on the dark web in order to share child porn among the users. Stewart made a stamen regarding the members of the brand new specialist group against pedophiles:</p>
<p>&#8220;They may not be police officers at all, they may be specialist IT experts. There may be a mixture because these people, their skill set is quite rare and we may have to look internationally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stewart also added that Argos has been already working on the same areas, however, they will provide more resources to Orion in order for them to do their work more efficiently.</p>
<p>According to Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, the new task force will be funded as part of a $3.2 million child protection package coming from the Commission of Inquiry into Organised Crime. Palaszczuk stated that the package will also include superior IT devices for task force members along with enhanced training for the regional officers and an increased storage capacity for police evidence databases.</p>
<p>The Queensland government’s opposition has been obstructing the commission of inquiry, arguing on the matter that government was only using it as an excuse to scrap the former Newman Government&#8217;s anti-bikie legislation. John-Paul Langbroek, the leader of Deputy Opposition said that the inquiry’s hearings haven’t been held in public, despite the fact that the hearings have been originally meant to be public. According to Langbroek, the government was politicizing the report in order to use it for the announcement of Taskforce Orion.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a parliamentarian I find them irresponsible; as a Queenslander I find them reckless; as a parent I find it abhorrent,&#8221; Langbroek said in his parliament speech.</p>
