<p><a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/dark-web-on-the-agenda-of-global-investigators-meet-in-new-delhi-766303">The 6th Global Focal Point Conference on Asset Recovery will be hosted by Interpol in New Delhi.</a> According to the press, the main focus of the conference will be the dark web in general and Bitcoin. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India’s special police, made this statement about the dark net:</p>
<p>”The Dark Web, which is commonly used by terror organisations and unscrupulous elements to communicate without getting intercepted by intelligence and security organisations has caused concerns in global security apparatusnet.”</p>
<p>Devpreet Singh, the CBI’s spokesperson also added this about Bitcoin:</p>
<p>”Another issue is Bitcoin, which have evolved as virtual currency and now are being used for transferring money for illicit deals across countries with the value of one Bitcoin estimated to be around $650.”</p>
<p>We have to add, there may be a miscalculation on Singh’s side since, as of today, BTC’s current price in USD is around $325, not $650.</p>
<p>The recently issued new system of international alert published by Interpol, Silver Notice, will also be discussed by the participants of the 51 countries that will attend the conference. The Silver Notice consists of points on how to locate, identify, obtain information, monitor, seize, freeze and confiscate assets of criminals by member states.</p>
<p>”Launched on 19th January 2009, the Global Focal Point is a partnership between StAR and Interpol which was created to promote and increase the exchange of corruption data among law enforcement agencies and anti-corruption entities worldwide”, Singh stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;StAR is a partnership between UNODC and World Bank. &#8216;Focal Points&#8217; are anti-corruption practitioners registered with the project who form an international network of experts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Interpol conference will be introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so as the ”21st Conference of CBI, state Anti-Corruption Bureaux and Vigilance Bureaux”. The CBI meeting will cover the topics of ”Evolving common approach to combat corruption across multiple jurisdictions”; ”Addressing challenges in the existing Anti-Corruption legal framework” and ”Best practices in Anti-Corruption Efforts”.</p>
