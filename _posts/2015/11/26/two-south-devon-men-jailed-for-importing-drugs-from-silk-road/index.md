    <p><a href="http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/South-Devon-men-jailed-using-website-shut-FBI-buy/story-28213043-detail/story.html">Nathan Wilson (30), and Jamie McAllister (35) has been both sentenced to prison for importing heroin and cannabis from the busted Silk Road marketplace.</a> According to law enforcement officials, the two men were paying via Western Union for the drugs that have been sold from India and Thailand by vendors.</p>
    <p>The border officials have intercepted packages containing illegal substances and were estimated to be worth £14.000 on the street at the time. McAllister when question by the local police, he told them that he was a legitimated businessman who bought sarongs and saris from the Far East. It was a rather bad move from him since later turned out that the site he ordered the packages was Silk Road, the infamous dark net market that has been shut down by the FBI.</p>
    <p>When the two “drug importers” were presented before Exeter Crown Court, they pleaded guilty for conspiracy to supply heroin and cannabis. McAllister was jailed for three years, Wilson for two years and eight months. James Waddington, Recorder QC made these statements:</p>
    <p>&#8220;These are both serious offences and in relation to both of you I&#8217;m quite satisfied that there&#8217;s no alternative to custodial sentences.”</p>
    <p>&#8220;The offences began when McAllister utilised the dark internet – the notorious Silk Road website – in order to source the drugs and got in contact with suppliers in Thailand and India and followed that initial contact up on the telephone.”</p>
    <p>&#8220;It resulted in three importations of drugs and these parcels were intercepted.”</p>
    <p>&#8220;In total there was 2,300g of cannabis and 74.6g of heroin with a combined street value of £14,000.”</p>
    <p>&#8220;It was McAllister who took the leading role of the two of you in initiating this contact. However, Wilson played also an important role without which this enterprise could not have taken place.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Two packages were sent to McAllister’s and one to Wilson’s address. The intercepted boxes were caught at March 2014. The total amount that has been transferred to Silk Road vendors, according to officials, was £3.800.</p>
    <p>Martin Salloway, defending McAllister, stated that his client had a &#8216;good work ethic&#8217; and was a good business man. The court was told that McAllister had previous history, convictions for drug possession and burglary.</p>
    <p>Kevin Hopper, who was representing Wilson, said that his client suffered from anxiety and depression and the conspiracy was not his idea. He also made these statements defending Wilson:</p>
    <p>&#8220;He gave his own identification details to Western Union and the drugs were sent to his home address, there was nothing sophisticated in it.”</p>
    <p>&#8220;He feels taken advantage of.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;He is hard working and works for the local authority.”</p>
