<p>In a ticket titled as &#8220;TOR CPU load 100%. Hidden service unavailable. Maybe zero-day vulnerability like &#8220;circuit storm&#8221;. &#8221;</p>
<p>Problem exist at all versions(0.2.5, 0.2.6, master from git) At current time few hidden services in TOR network DDOSed by this method.</p>
<p><strong>Several Market admins Have already contacted us confirming that they are under Ddos attack as well.</strong></p>
