<p>From the owners of the former Onion shop services &#8211; a guide for setting up hidden services:</p>
<p>Original post is on the hub: http://thehub7gqe43miyc.onion/index.php?topic=7507.0;topicseen<br/>
    All rights for this guide are reserved to the respective owner, and needless to say that <strong>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK</strong> &#8211; but we believed it might interest a few people so here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Howdy!</p>
<p>Didnt get much time to visit the Hub lately, but very glad you guys are still here and standing in times where fagots like evo admins jump ship and set us back like were in 2013 again.</p>
<p>With solid decentralisation a la openbazaar still not in action, we&#8217;re happy to see more and more vendors setting up individual shops and taking away the high serverload and the millions of commission from big markets.</p>
<p>For this reason we planned to launch Onionshop 2.0 earlier this year. The idea was to sell one-time licences which include the full source code for an independant darknetshop and a guide on how to set it up. We ended up with completely different projects though, so we decided to rather bury OS for now. I dont want to release the source code neither since we are going to use it elsewhere but here&#8217;s the installation tutorial on how to set up a hidden server. Since I spent some time writing it, Im sure it comes in handy to one or another who wants to set one up. It was written for the Onionshop 2.0 Setup, so maybe you dont need everything (for example the whole GnuPG part for pgp support).</p>
<p>We dont explain on how to set up a shop in this pdf, its just a guide on how to get a hidden service running in general. With the current situation of markets I assume more people than usual are currently playing around with hidden services and setting them up, so they may catch up one or another advice from this doc. cant emphasize enough that there is obviously a lot that can be done to further improve the set up and that it takes more knowhow than a 20 page pdf to run a server safely.</p>
<p>Peace<br/>
    OS</p></blockquote>
