<blockquote><p>FRESNO, Calif. — A federal grand jury returned a one-count indictment today against Bryan Austin Frembling, 20, resident of Fresno, charging him with possessing MDMA (“Ecstasy”), with intent to distribute, United States Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner announced.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Frembling ordered the ecstasy from the internet.  It was delivered from Canada to a post office box in another individual’s name.  Frembling was arrested on January 5, 2015 as he picked up the package of drugs from the post office.</p>
<p>This case was the product of an investigation by the Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Postal Service, and Fresno Police Department. Assistant United States Attorney Kathleen A. Servatius is prosecuting the case.</p>
<p>Frembling has been released on bail pending the disposition of the charges and will appear in court to be arraigned on the indictment on February 24, 2015.</p>
<p>If convicted, Frembling faces a maximum statutory penalty of twenty years in prison and a $1 million fine. Any sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables. The charges are only allegations; the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p></blockquote>
