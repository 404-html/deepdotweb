<p>Apparently Lizard squad &#8211; the &#8220;hacker team&#8221; who DDos&#8217;ed Xbox live servers on Christmas,  have managed to find a sure plan to land them in prison for a while,</p>
<p>Few weeks after launching lizardstresser.su (blocked in most regions)- A platform for purchasing automated Ddos services that was <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Lizard-Squad-s-DDoS-Website-Gets-Hacked-Passwords-Stored-In-Plain-Text-470333.shtml">hacked</a> shortly after its launch and found to be operating on hacked <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/01/lizard-stresser-runs-on-hacked-home-routers/">home routers</a>, with all the passwords stored in plain text, not too long after a couple of this group members were <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/whos-in-the-lizard-squad/">doxxed</a> and arrested. The group have announced on twitter and on lizardstresser.su homepage that they are about to launch something called &#8220;Shenron LLC&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
<p>Shenron LLC &#8212; coming soon.</p>
<p>&mdash; Lizard Squad (@LizardPhoenix) <a href="https://twitter.com/LizardPhoenix/status/561711358006538240">February 1, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A bunch of services composed of:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: underline;">Drugs</span></span></strong><br />
    With Shenron you can securely purchase drugs and have them shipped to your doorstep!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #cccccc;">Stresser</span></strong></span><br />
    Perform ddos services with ease, ddos protection won&#8217;t be a problem with the amount of power you will be wielding.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: underline;">Advertising</span></strong></span><br />
    With our SEO &amp; Spamming services you can gain popularity with ease!</p></blockquote>
<p>While its hard to say if this is serious or just trolling and although we can agree that the spamming services might sound like a fun thing to use, it would be advised for any Dark Net Market (Or Clearnet market) user to think two or three times before using any type of drugs market launched by this group, not to mention sending your BTC at this direction and stick to the well <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/dark-net-market-comparison-chart/">established markets</a> like <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/agora-market">Agora</a> and <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/evolution-marketplace">Evolution</a>.  So keep this name in mind. And get your popcorn ready.</p>
