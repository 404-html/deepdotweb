The lawmakers told Reuters that <em>“The government should clamp down on bitcoin. It’s simply not enough to just ask people to exercise caution when investing. It has to ban the circulation of such virtual currency in the market.”</em></p>

    <p><strong>Regulation</strong></p>
    <p>Utah legislator Mark K. Roberts encourages the use of bitcoin as a legitimate form of payment.</p>
    <p>William Suberg of <a href="http://cointelegraph.com/news/113476/good-news-for-overstock-utah-considers-bitcoin-payment-for-state-services">Coin Telegraph</a> reports that H.C.R. 6 “Concurrent Resolution on Payment Options for State Services” introduced by Roberts is an action towards actively considering to legalize the digital currency following the States of New York and California.</p>

    <p>Russia might consider bitcoin regulation. As Chris Pomoni of <a href="http://newsbtc.com/2015/02/10/moshkov-flirts-bitcoin-regulation/">NewsBtc</a> writes, Alexey Moshkov of the</p>
    <p>Ministry of Internal Affairs favors the introduction of a legislative policy that would allow the bitcoin regulation of the Russian Central Bank.

Akif Khan, VP of Bitnet believes that “<em>It&#8217;s very much in the airlines’ interest for the consumer to pay with bitcoin given that the airline will have cheaper fees and they know that money can&#8217;t be taken away in a fraudulent transaction.”</em></p>
    <p>Google is fond of the bitcoin. The tech giant in cooperation with Square is building and testing new payment systems that can accept payments in bitcoins.
