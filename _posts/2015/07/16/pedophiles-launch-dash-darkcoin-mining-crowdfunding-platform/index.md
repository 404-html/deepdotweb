<p>It seems that innovation never stops in the those dark corners of the internet, 9 months ago we reported about a new &#8220;startup&#8221; created by Dark Web Pedo&#8217;s attempting to provide a <a href="/2014/11/09/as-drug-markets-are-seized-pedophiles-launch-a-crowdfunding-site/">crowdfunding platform</a> for uploading and distributing child abuse content financed by the site&#8217;s visitors &#8211; which later failed, shutdown and was deemed as either scam or a failed honeypot.</p>
<p>This time, we followed a tip about a fairly new and suspiciously similar site (who&#8217;s name &amp; url we won&#8217;t mention, from obvious reasons) offering a similar service with a little twist in his &#8220;business model&#8221; &#8211; instead of setting a threshold amount of Bitcoins and wait for its fulfillment in order to release the uploaded content to the buyers, users must contribute their computer resources to &#8220;mine&#8221; <a href="/?s=darkcoin">Darkcoins</a> (now branded as &#8220;<a href="https://www.dashpay.io/">Dash</a>&#8220;) &#8211; a privacy-centric digital currency which offers advanced anonymity features.</p>
<p>By installing a <a href="https://www.dashpay.io/mining/">Dash miner</a> on their computer the users are able redeem the locked content once a pre-defined amount of coins have been mined and paid out to the uploader who turns his &#8220;content&#8221; into profit. And by creating this process, inventing a new method for content distribution, as far as we know (please comment with correction if wrong). Used in the wrong context for the first time.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, a crowd funding site we can all support!</p></blockquote>
<p>The homepage states and than goes on and explains how it works:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s because you can contribute without ever paying for CP. Instead, this server will mine darkcoins and use those to pay people who upload private photos and videos. You can help by instructing your computer to connect to our stratum miner through tor and some of the mining calculations used to create these darkcoins will be outsourced to your computer. You can choose which video or photo set you want your mining calculations to go towards and any darkcoin created using your calculations will go into an account just for your chosen video or photo set. When that account reaches the number of darkcoins the uploader asked for, they are all paid to him and the video or set is made available for download to everyone, even to people who could not contribute anything. If more people help with the mining calculations, then CP gets released faster and more people will be willing to upload.</p></blockquote>
<p>And closing with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you excited?</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe LE will get excited? who knows.</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2015/07/open1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11072" src="/imgs/2015/07/open1.png" alt="open1" width="795" height="438" srcset="/imgs/2015/07/open1.png 795w, /imgs/2015/07/open1-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></a></p>
<p>The Site offers instructions on how to mine the coins safely through a Tor connection:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2015/07/safe3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11073" src="/imgs/2015/07/safe3.png" alt="safe3" width="753" height="803" srcset="/imgs/2015/07/safe3.png 753w, /imgs/2015/07/safe3-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></a></p>
<p>With clear instruction of how to unlock the &#8220;content&#8221; using miners for various operating systems:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2015/07/unlock1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11074" src="/imgs/2015/07/unlock1.png" alt="unlock1" width="719" height="413" srcset="/imgs/2015/07/unlock1.png 719w, /imgs/2015/07/unlock1-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></a></p>
<p>Lets just hope that this will fail like the previous one and that this method will be used to achieve better goals.</p>
