    <p><a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/first-picture-teenager-accused-plotting-6124856">Liam Lyburd, a former college student of Newcastle College, has pleaded guilty to nine charges</a> including the possession of a 9mm Luger Caliber Glock firearm, the manufacture of five pipe bombs and two other homemade explosives.</p>
    <p>Liam’s mother has showed the police his son’s stash where they have found the Glock gun, 94 jacketed hollow point expanding bullets, tear gas and several homemade explosive devices, including pipe bombs that he made himself.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3edft5/man_in_uk_purchased_firearms_via_dnms_and_got/">The angry teen had an intent to carry out a mass murder at the students</a> of his former college. However, he has denied the charges that said he has possessed the weapons and the ammunition with an intent to endanger the lives of the students in Newcastle College. After he has been arrested, the teenager stated that it has been just a fantasy in his head, but he did not have any intent to carry out a massacre at his former college.</p>
    <p>Prosecutor Nick Dry has informed the Newcastle Crown Court that the police have found about the plot in November, when under the name of Felix Burns, the teenager has made a Facebook post about carrying out a mass murder.</p>
    <p>Nick Dry also said: “He then stated that he had intended to carry out a mass murder at Newcastle College that very day and that the officers had saved lives, preventing what would have otherwise been a massacre at the college.</p>
    <p>“He repeated to them that it had been his intention to blow up the college and, as he put it, ‘to shoot a bunch of people’, laughing as he was transported to the police station and speculating that he would get four years for it.”</p>
    <p>The police officers also have found a so-called “kill bag” in his bedroom, which has contained several pipe bombs, a balaclava, elbow and knee pads, safety gloves. Law enforcement authorities think that Liam would use this bag to carry out the murder at his former college. The other bag that they have found in his bedroom must have been a stash where he has held his weapons.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement authorities has stated that Lyburd has been operating under the usernames of “The Joker” and “I Love My Anger” when he has purchased the weapons from various Deepnet Markets that he has intended to use for the massacre. Authorities also said that he used Bitcoins for the purchase of the items</p>
    <p>Lyburd had conversations on Skype with a girl from Iceland where he spoke about his desire to kill the students of the Newcastle College and had referenced the Jaylen Fryberg college murder in the United States and the Anders Brevik mass murder in Norway as an example. Through this conversation, he also told his Skype partner that he also has an intention for shooting commuters on the Newcastle Metro system. He also stated that in the case his gun would jam, he would use a machete for killing.</p>
    <p>The teenager has a YouTube channel where you can see videos of him showing people how to load and use a Glock handgun. This could also be considered as evidence in the intention of carrying out a massacre.</p>
    <p>There have been several notes found that has been originated from Lyburd:</p>
    <p>“You people ruined my whole life don’t expect me to show mercy today. No one disrespects me and gets away with it.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll teach you people a little lesson on respect with my 9mm jacketed hollow points.</p>
    <p>“It’s time for extreme civil disobedience.</p>
    <p>“Fantasy will become reality today for sure. Where the mind goes the body will follow and yes people will die there’s no question about that.”</p>
    <p>Police investigations has revealed that there were Facebook conversations on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of November where Lyburd has stated that he will carry out the attack on the commuters the next day, however, later he has made a post that said: “I&#8217;m not going to do it today, I just can&#8217;t.”</p>
    <p>Although his Facebook post said that he couldn’t carry out the massacre that day, prosecutor Nick Dry has stated that the prosecution can’t accept this fact, since the teenager has told comments to the police officers that could prove that Lyburd had every intention to kill.</p>
    <p>Mr Dry has also stated: &#8220;It is for those reasons, says the prosecution, that this was no improbable fantasy of a naive daydreamer divorced from reality, but a carefully planned revenge attack, constructed and resourced by an embittered yet highly skilled and savvy computer hacker”, who identified himself &#8220;with those responsible for recent mass killings around the world&#8221;.</p>
    <p>Another proof that could show Lyburd’s intent for revenge killing is that he was a student in 2012 for five weeks only, because he was kicked out of the school for shocking behaviour.</p>
