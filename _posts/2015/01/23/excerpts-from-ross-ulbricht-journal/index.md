</ul>
<p><strong>06/03/2013</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>put cimon in charge of LE counter intel</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&#8230;06/05/2013 &#8211; 09/11/2013</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;[redacted] did an interview with andy greenberg from forbes where i said i wasn&#8217;t the original DPR, went over well with community [redacted]&#8230;r&amp;w flaked out and disappeared with my 1/2 mil&#8230;similarly cimon has been working on the mining and gambling projects, but no results forthcoming. created Anonymous Bitcoin Exchange (ABE) and have been trying to recruit tellers. the vendor &#8220;gold&#8221; is my best lead at the moment. nod is an H dealer on SR who says he has world class it skills and I am giving him a chance to show his stuff with ABE&#8230;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>09/12/2013</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Got a tip from oldamsterdam that supertrips has been busted. [redacted]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>09/11 &#8211; 09/18/2013</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>could not confirm ST bust. [redacted] &#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>09/19/2013</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>red pinged me and asked for meeting tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>09/19 &#8211; 09/25/2013</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>red got in a jam and needed $500k to get out. ultimately he convinced me to give it to him, but I got his ID first and had cimon send harry, his new soldier of fortune, to vancouver to get $800k in cash to cover it. red has been mainly out of communication, but i haven&#8217;t lost hope. Atlantis shut down. I was messaged by one of their team who said they shut down because of an FBI doc leaked to them detailing vulnerabilities in Tor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Many interesting points here:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Atlantis mystery seems to&#8217;ve been resolved. They had no reason to lie to DPR that I can think of.</li>
<li>We know Supertrips <em>had</em> been busted</li>
<li>DPR was paying out an astounding amount in ransoms and whatnot</li>
<li>The IP was leaking all the time</li>
<li>The Redandwhite story gets more and more insane.It&#8217;s possible that it will feature in testimony. It would be interesting if &#8216;Brian Shaw&#8217; turned out to be cimon&#8217;s guy&#8230;</li>
<li>Cimon failed utterly at his job of &#8216;LE counter intel&#8217;; why did he get paid $50k? (Bonus points: he was being paid it not long before the UC.)</li>
<li>Emailgate</li>
<li>Several entries are echoed in DPR&#8217;s spreadsheet: the cimon payment, the RAW loan, the Mtgox theft</li>
</ul>
