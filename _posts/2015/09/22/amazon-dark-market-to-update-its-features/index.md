<p><strong>You may notice that our listing count has gone down, this is due to our automatic Vacation Mode. Vendors that have not logged in for a week or more are now in vacation mode and had their listings made inactive.</strong></p>
<p>Premium Sellers free upgrades are still available for reputable vendors, any seller that has at least 100 feedback from reviews that can be found on Grams is eligible. Thank you for your patience in regards to the release of this update, it has been a long time coming and we hope you all enjoy the changes.</p>
