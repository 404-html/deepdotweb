<p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay">Alphabay</a>, the market who is expected to take the lead after <a href="/2015/08/26/agora-market-to-pause-operations-finish-your-orders-and-withdraw-money/">Agora will be gone</a> &#8211; has come back from a downtime, needed to upgrade their infrastructure due the huge increase of Agora refugees traffic. This was their official announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>First of all, apologies for the downtime and coming back online a bit late. We wanted to make sure everything was all right before announcing it. We got a brand new infrastructure and we are ready for the big user influx.</p>
<p>*** IMPORTANT *** Do not send coins to your old Bitcoin addresses. Simply head to your Balance page and get your new deposit address.</p>
<p>We recuperated all the coins from the old hot wallets and made a new brand new one. We will keep the old wallet server online for 72 hours in case someone mistakenly sends coins to an old address, but this is a manual process and you will have to wait a bit if you make a mistake. Just send coins to the right address and you will be fine. To round things up, all Escrow countdowns have been extended for 48 hours, same goes for auto-declining orders.</p>
<p>We are back online in full force now, and hope you enjoy your new experience. With the slowdown problems out of the way, we are now ready to spend our time putting new features and growing our community even more.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody for being part of the team! The technicians will watch the Bug Reports section closely in case of problems, but it shouldn&#8217;t happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>We contacted one of Alphabay Market admins who also added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are giving free vendor bonds to Agora vendor refugees. We would like to remind if any scamming should occur (we are aware Agora scammers would join the party too) please post topic in Scam Reports section and your case will be handled by a member of ScamWatch. Soon we will have new exciting features for AlphaBay users, stay tuned!</p></blockquote>
