<p>According to a <a href="http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/697-dark-web-gun-fantasist-pleads-guilty">press release</a> fron the UK national crime agency &#8211; A Milton Keynes man who concocted an elaborate story to purchase a gun from the dark web today pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import a firearm and ammunition at Bristol Crown Court.</p>
<p>Darren Hillyer, aged 38, posed as a woman aiming to exact revenge on a paedophile ex-lover. Hillyer ordered a Luger LC9 9mm handgun and 50 rounds of ammunition from an account on a dark web forum under the guise of ‘Emma’.</p>
<p>He was unaware that the package he was due to receive was in fact a plastic replica hidden inside a DAB radio which was under the control of officers from the National Crime Agency.</p>
<p>Hillyer had contacted 47 year-old Ian MacPhee, from Newton Abbot, Devon, who he had met online in a chat room but had never met in person, and convinced him to receive the package and forward it to him.</p>
<p>As MacPhee entered a post office in Newton Abbott unaware of what was in the parcel, NCA Officers moved in and arrested him on the morning of 28 July.</p>
<p>After tracing the forwarding address, officers arrested Hillyer later that afternoon at an insolvency company in Euston,London, where he worked as an IT manager.</p>
<p>When officers spoke to Hillyer’s colleagues they described him as a ‘fantasist’ and a ‘Walter Mitty type character’. They said he claimed that he that worked for the intelligence and security services who had issued him a gun.</p>
<p>Under interview Hillyer also claimed his activity on the dark web was part of research to help him apply to join the NCA.</p>
<p>Hillyer and MacPhee appeared at Bristol Crown Court on 10 September 2015, with Hillyer pleading guilty to conspiracy to import a firearm and ammunition. MacPhee pled guilty to attempting to evade the duty on an imported item.</p>
<p>The pair are due to be sentenced at Bristol Crown Court on 30 October.</p>
<p>Peter Vernon, senior investigating officer for the NCA, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;People looking to obtain illicit goods and services under the supposed anonymity of the dark web continue to discover that they can in fact be traced and identified.</p>
<p>“It would appear Hillyer was trying to live out a fantasy but attempting to buy a firearm in the real world has real life consequences.</p>
<p>“The NCA will continue to collaborate with our national and international partners to prevent and disrupt serious cyber-enabled criminality.&#8221;</p>
