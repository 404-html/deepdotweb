<p>If you are following the news of the deep web then you will be pretty much surprised by this news. Most of the “happenings” are in North America, Australia, the UK and in Western Europe, however, this article is about a <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Police-Dark-Net-child-pornography-ring-busted-415381">pedophile ring that has been taken down by the Israeli police</a>.</p>
<p>According the information that has been given out by the police to the media, more than a dozen people have been arrested in a huge police raid that has taken place in 17 houses all across the country. The raid was organized by the Israeli Police’s cyber crime unit. LE also stated that the suspects have been running a darknet CP ring. During the law enforcement raid, the police have seized computers holding about 100 gigabytes of child pornography in different file forms.</p>
<p>The leader of the investigation was the Israeli National Crime Unit, the Lahav 433. Lahav 433’s cyber crime unit, they were responsible for discovering the trails and the place of the partakers of the CP trade ring. The investigation has been going on from April, last year, where the cybercrime unit has arrested two suspects (15 and 17 years old) who have been accused of trading child pornography.</p>
<p>The same division of the Lahav 433 was responsible for the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/07/15/darkode-com-seized-by-cross-borders-task-force/">joint FBI raid of the Darkode Forum that has been taken down in July 2015</a>. For those who did not know: the Darkode forum has been used by cyber criminals as a black market to trade stolen data, credit card information, email addresses, hacking tools and information on bugs and vulnerabilities used to coordinate attacks on companies, agencies and governments.</p>
<p>Israel’s cyber crime unit was founded by the Israel Police in 2012, and its main task is to find hackers, pedophiles and DNMs operating on the darknet.</p>
