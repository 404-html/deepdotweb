<p><strong>BBVA Bank of Spain on mainstreaming Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>BBVA bank, Spain’s second largest bank, this week released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8S-wkpBDW0">video tutorial</a> on how to send and receive payments via bitcoin! The video, walks users through the process of opening a wallet, backing it up, purchasing and sending bitcoins. It also simultaneously released a report on blockchain technology title <a href="https://ihb.io/2015-08-10/news/bbva-blockchain-technology-poised-financial-industrys-biggest-disruptor-yet-22330"><em>Blockchain technology poised to be financial industry’s biggest disruptor yet</em></a><em>. </em>The Spanish bank, an investor in Coinbase (US &amp; European Bitcoin exchange), is an indicator of growing investor and mainstream interest in applications of blockchain and to some extent, bitcoins. Interestingly, the bank’s fintech awards features 3 bitcoin start ups</p>
<p><strong>New York BitLicense Wards Off Exchange business </strong></p>
<p>2 of the largest bitcoin exchanges by funding and trading volume,Kraken and Bitfinex, have cut off services to New York residents, geofencing the island after expiry of a 40 day grace period. Bitlicense regulations are set to kick in, and a number start ups in this space aren’t too pleased by onerous application and compliance rules &#8211; for instance, a $ $ 5,000 non-refundable application fee. Still, exchanges such as Bitstamp, itBit, Coinsetter and Gemini are more than happy to comply, if that what it takes to operate in the state.</p>
<p>Kraken CEO Jesse Powell spoke to <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchanges-kraken-and-bitstamp-cut-services-in-new-york/">Coindesk</a> saying</p>
<p>Powell said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t see the entire NY exchange market being worth the costs associated with compliance with the BitLicense”</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum token trading goes live, market down 80%</strong></p>
<p>As per <a href="http://insidebitcoins.com/news/ethereum-launches-frontier-ether-mining-begins-trading-to-follow/34124">Inside Bitcoins</a>, Ethereum native token,ether,began trading this week across multiple exchange, after the decay thawing period ie when transactions on the network begin. Gatecoin, Kraken, Poloniex, Yunbi facilitate trades; <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/bitmex-launches-weekly-ether-bitcoin-futures-contract/">BitMex</a>, listed a futures contract under the ticker symbol ETH7D. Soon after trading went live, about 1 million ether were dumped, sending the price down 80%. Not exactly a confidence booster</p>
<p><strong>This Week on Bitcoin Markets</strong></p>
<p>This week the price of bitcoin exhibited weakness, and fell to $260. Choppy EMAs and MAs &#8211; 52, 100, 200 and 30, could not support the price, which breached all of them on lower time frames (below 6 hours). As of writing this, price is at $ 265, after pulling back from a huge drop from $280. Depending on what you look at (MAs, EMAs), price direction sentiment has seemingly changed, telling from forum discussions on the same. A far cry from prominent ‘moontalk’ and calls of a bottom well behind us from last month.</p>
<p><em>“I think we are going down and am holding my short from $280.40 on OKcoin weekly futures. However, I think it&#8217;s possible we may push up to $275 before heading back down to $260 or below.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-11255" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1.png" alt="1" width="792" height="486" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1.png 1500w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1-1024x629.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px"/></a></p>
<p>This chart plots the 52 day EMA, as far back as 2012. Back in April 2014 it acted as a strong support for a rally up to $680, but, market broke below it later in August. July’s peak at $ 316 was rejected, all the way down to $260. Considering how long the market has held below it and even longer above it (in the preceding bull run from 2012), this rejection to $260 is reasonable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11256" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/21.jpg" alt="2" width="596" height="438" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/21.jpg 596w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/21-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"/></a></p>
<p>The 1 week price chart shows where to expect a bounce back up, off the 30 day MA &#8211; at around $250. A triangular formation broke down, similar to December. I am not fully convinced prices moving to higher price territory is off the table. Watch for rebounds back up around $243 &#8211; $255 zone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11257" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/31.jpg" alt="3" width="595" height="465" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/31.jpg 595w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/31-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px"/></a></p>
<p>This chart superimposes multiple fibonacci lines for 3 peak to peak moves &#8211; $475 &#8211; $166. $166 &#8211; $316 and $219 &#8211; $316. Market sits just above $ 256; the next level after is $ 240. There remains a case to be made for higher prices, based on whether 2 levels are respected &#8211; $255 and $ 243.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/41.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11258" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/41.jpg" alt="4" width="594" height="463" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/41.jpg 594w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/41-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px"/></a></p>
<p><em>“Perhaps surprisingly the overall daily picture remains generally Bullish”</em></p>
<p>If this bullish trendline is anything to go by. Sideways price action is possible, as long as fibonacci price levels are respected.</p>
<p><strong>Sidenote</strong></p>
<p>In last week’s price analysis, using EW, i projected a final wave 5 after topping at out $ 316 as wave 3. After this week’s price action, the possibility that a 5 th wave already happened surfaced. A truncated 5th wave, not exactly the most common pattern, but do occur and are documented in EW study material.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/51.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11259" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/51.jpg" alt="5" width="681" height="238" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/51.jpg 681w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/51-300x105.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px"/></a></p>
<p>This would imply the pullback off $273 (4) to $ 298 (5) was the failed 5th wave &#8211; a bull market truncation.</p>
<p><strong>Market Outlook</strong></p>
<p>After this week’s market action, I am expect sideways action to slight rise in price &#8211; up to $ 273 &#8211; $281, after which another move down should follow. Despite this week’s sharp drop in price, I still expect prices of up to $325 at some point. Observing this move down is key. Invalidation of this forecast ($325) would occur if $240 was broken with strong intent. This would mark a return to the bear market, based on some chart visuals like this one.</p>

<p>Safe to say the market is in a decisive zone.</p>
