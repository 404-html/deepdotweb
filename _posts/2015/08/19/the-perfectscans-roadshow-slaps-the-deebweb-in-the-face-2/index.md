<p><span class="im">Yes, you read that right, it&#8217;s been a long time coming and the voice of sanity you have missed, lost in the wilderness of relays trying to find their way home, to give the answers for those who have been waiting.</p>
<p>1001 one ways to make your head go boom. Deebdotweb has given PS a new home.</p>
<p>PS..is back baby and damn I look more handsome today than I did yesterday. I cannot wait for <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_430282249"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span> :)</p>
<p>But first things first, its bitch slap time !!</p>
<p>Lets start with Blake Benthall&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you remember us contacting you ? do you remember the warning about LE insiders ? do you remember the weeks we devoted to helping you figure who ?</p>
<p>Do you remember the unwavering support the guild was offering you ? New ID, flights, safe houses and yet you cowered alone in your room too scared and stupid to listen to those on your side ? people with vastly more experience, resources and capabilities than you. Yet you sat alone with agents on all sides terrified someone might steal your bitcoins.</p>
<p>Well; you did not listen, you did not take the olive branch and you did not make professional decisions to ensure the future of the silk road or yourself. Greed and fear were you guides and we hope you enjoy your stay.</p>
<p></span> Oh and SR admin; do you remember when PS said you were all a bunch of Muppets.<span class="im"></p>
<p>We rest our case.</p>
<p>Now; lets bring some light to dark places and re-ignite hope, lets build a new world inside their world and become greater and stronger than before.</p>
<p>Over the next months you, me, us and and them are going to fix the deebweb once and for all !!</p>
<p>As we can no longer function with scam after scam, market seizure after market scam, vendors scams, exit scams, 60+ markets and nobody you can trust.</p>
<p>No Vendor can sustain the constant bonds paid, losses made and blank screens for answers. No customers can continue throwing coins at pretty pictures and comforting themselves that a shitty feedback replaces their lost $$$$. As that same scamming cunt opens a new vendor account <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_430282250"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span>. New pics, new BS and around we go again.</p>
<p>Markets don&#8217;t care, they get their share and only the vendor and the customer meets the cost of loss. While all the while being shamed like pedophiles for smoking some grass.</p>
<p>Seriously !! can 60+ markets with NO idea who is behind, no proven or trusted names ? an almost weekly round of scamming possibly serve the deebweb ? Can we continue to be driven into hiding, losing friends and watching innocent men hang ?</p>
<p>While they protect the child rapers, and pursue us as criminals, using their profits from drugs, fraud, extortion and weapons sales to fund their crusade.</p>
<p>If you are struggling here. The answer is NO.</p>
<p>Lets face it kids. We are being driven into the sea !! And whats more, we are being driven into the sea by the most powerful criminals you have ever seen.</p>
<p>MEMEX comes our way next and ELLIPTIC fires up its clever machine as they convince us tor can be or is already broken, bitcoin is 100% traceable and nobody can avoid their detection.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t Panic !! :) That is what they NEED you to believe. Much like a Rabbi hiding his hardon as he holds a small boy. He NEEDS you to believe god is everywhere, all powerful and always watching.</p>
<p>That way you remain, frozen in headlights, unsure of what is right or wrong and to afraid to question as his hand slips down your pants as he convinces you this is right.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be that boy !!</p>
<p></span> Be the boy who realizes that fear is their source of power and kick that kiddly fiddling bitch in his tiny balls and shout; fuck you !<span class="im"></p>
<p>Breathe in the lightening joy of realizing their morality is nothing more than a control program that allows them the freedom to act without consequence and you, the freedom to do nothing more than they say you can.</p>
<p>Enjoy the knowledge that MEMEX can do little else than trawl the deebweb just like google could anyways and eliptic cannot link anything you do not give them to link.</p>
<p>And TOR is not broken nor can it be !! it simply needs our funding and support.</p>
<p>Still unsure ? then ask yourself the following:</p>
<p>Why has not ONE single bust has taken place due to blockchain analysis ?</p>
<p>Without a direct link from market to your own personal name. They are spinning numbers out of their asses. Much like trying to arrest you and say one of those US dollar notes in your pocket was used in a crime 2 years so we are arresting you for it.</p>
<p>Ya, good luck with that officer :)</p>
<p>Next up is the ELLIPTIC crew who are riding a wave of fear and ignorance and hoping to cash in.</p>
<p>With such omnipotent search and trace power ask yourself this;</p>
<p>Is that why the ONLY way they found SR, or indeed ANY tor hidden service is through illegally hacking their way in ? turning those arrested into inside agents or undercover infiltration.</p>
<p>We wont even mention the 2.8MILLION in BITCOINS the FBI stole for their own uses :))</p>
<p>As for the unspeakable treatment of a young man called Ross whose only real crime is defiance, yet he faces twice to three times the sentence of a child killer.</p>
<p>We start to see your governments REAL priorities and ways.</p>
<p>So as we enter into the 3rd year of this war on criminals by criminals I say, stand firm and bring it on.</p>
<p>You bunch of corrupt, retarded asshats too blind, too poorly educated too fucking dumb to realize that your very pay masters are the most criminal elements in our world today. And you stand, gun at your side, badge in hand, proudly representing their special brand of bullshit as opium pours out of Afghanistan in the TONNES loaded into Hercules and due for our streets next week.</p>
<p></span> NO customs, no checks and the next CIA plane leaves mexico so overloaded with coke, it struggles to maintain altitude as it fly&#8217;s the next batch of black ops funding and social engineering goldust into the USA.<span class="im"></p>
<p>Are you tired of this bullshit yet ? are you truly sick of this slave program with one rule for them, one for us ? and we always pay the bills ?</p>
<p>I know you are !! and you are not alone. There are millions of us.</p>
<p>Together we shall design, build, create the greatest human system ever known and you will see a deebweb beyond your imaginations with solid foundations, trusted vendors, trusted clients and the free trade and free choices you deserve.</p>
<p>This is the beginnings of freedom my friends, something we have not tasted for 1000&#8217;s of years and it all begins right here, today.</p>
<p>PS shall lead and together we find our promised lands :)</p>
<p>Wait till you see what is coming !!</p>
<p>And Remember: Lucy Loves You</p>
<p>x</span></p>
