<p><a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/families-sa-paedophile-shannon-mccoole-sentenced-to-35-years-in-jail-for-horrific-sexual-abuse-of-children-in-care/story-fni6uo1m-1227474133348">Former Families Worker in South Australia, Shannon Grant McCoole (33) has pleaded guilty to a horrifying list of sex crimes against underaged children in his care and was sentenced to 35 years in jail</a>. His crime was brutal, one of the children he molested was only 18 months old. There were even children who had autism or were disabled.</p>
<p>He was not only a family worker at the time, but it was proven that he was running a darknet child pornography website, called The Love Zone. The domain had more than 47000 users, until the closedown of the site, 6 months after the caught of the website administrator (McCoole). It looks like McCoole has used the ”skee” username for the running of the CP darknet site.</p>
<p>McCoole AKA skee has posted this message on The Love Zone pedophile site:</p>
<p>”TLZ is a living creature. We have survived a lot of ups and downs. Its been a passion of mine for a long time, and TLZ is bigger than ever. In the past we have taken a Christmas break on our contributions, because at this time of year a lot of people are away and can&#8217;t get onto the site safely, but that break doesn’t give the admin team time off.</p>
<p>Believe it or not the board doesn’t run itself and requires a lot of thankless hours from all the Admins, Co admins and mods. So the board will go into maintenance mode till the new year to give the admin team time to take a break. I’ll leave this a few days so that you people can see the message.</p>
<p>TLZ will return in 2015 refreshed and better than ever. For those that want to chat and do some basic trading Newcummers will remain open, and thats where you will find me.</p>
<p>In the near future you all should be able to login at NCC with a member account using your TLZ user name and password, if you don&#8217;t already have an account.</p>
<p>I will announce the boards official reopening date, and its new address, in Newcummers when all the admin team have returned.”</p>
<p>This post was made after the arrest of Shannon Grant McCoole, law enforcement documents show that he got caught in June 2014. After the admin of the domain has been arrested, law enforcement authorities have taken over the website, until they have finally closed it down in December 2014.</p>
<p>At The Love Zone, McCoole’s profile has included this information his occupation was listed as “professional photographic sex instructor”, his interests as “anything below 12”, and his hobby as “Sex, sex, sex, more sex, natural weight loss for chubby kids”.</p>
<p>Shannon Grant McCoole has been sentenced by South Australian court to 35 years in prison with a 28 years non-parole period. 35 years is the maximum time that could be given to sex offenders in South Australia. The judge of District Court, Paul Rice, has told this to McCole:</p>
<p>“You have no moral compass. You were excited and sought sexual satisfaction, not just from touching very young children but also having sexual intercourse with infants. What would incline you to do such a thing is far beyond my comprehension. It engenders feelings of outrage and revulsion among right-thinking people.”</p>
<p>“One of the most remarkable submission laid on your behalf is that when you are eventually released you wish to work with young people who may have paedophilic tendencies like you did so as to help them,” he said.</p>
<p>“What arises from that is that there are serious reservations that I have about your insight into your offending. Knowing what I do about your offending it is fanciful in the extreme for you to contemplate that you may be permitted to work with young people ever again.”</p>
<p>„It is absurd to suggest that you needed education within Families SA to gain that realisation,” Rice said. “These last two topics cause me to be very guarded about your long-term prospects of rehabilitation.”</p>
<p>After the police bust on McCoole’s house, law enforcement authorities have found more than 100,000 still images and 600 videos and other media files of child exploitation material on the criminal’s computer.</p>
<p>The child molester and The Love Zone admin has agreed with the court to provide evidence to the Royal Commission that will help their work to probe 10 key areas in Australia to ensure the safety of the children.</p>
