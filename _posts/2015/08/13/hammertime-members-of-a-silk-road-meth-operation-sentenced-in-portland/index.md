    <p>Two players who worked with the biggest methamphetamine dealer on the dark-net site &#8220;Silk Road&#8221; were sentenced Wednesday for their roles in the conspiracy (<a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=Hammertime">Vendor Hammertime</a>).</p>
    <p>Senior U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones sentenced Richard E. Webster to 2 ½ years in prison and gave Chelsea L. Reder credit for time served (she had served a day in jail) because, as Jones put it, &#8220;She was a small pebble in a huge operation.&#8221;</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18528069-mmmain1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11264" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18528069-mmmain1.jpg" alt="18528069-mmmain[1]" width="620" height="465" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18528069-mmmain1.jpg 620w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18528069-mmmain1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"/></a></p>
    <p>The operation was run by Jason Weld Hagen, scarcely your standard meth dealer. The 40-year-old Vancouver resident, who holds a doctoral degree in philosophy from Purdue, pleaded guilty in February to running a $607,000 drug and money laundering conspiracy.</p>
    <p>Hagen operated on Silk Road, an anonymous Internet marketplace that opened in 2011, a kind of Wild West bazaar for illegal guns, heroin, false passports and all manner of shady transactions. And it was all hidden on the cloud, an open secret with a website full of advertisements.</p>
    <p>Hagen, who used the screen name &#8220;hammertime,&#8221; bypassed banks by converting Bitcoin cyber-money. He first got Reder to mail packages for him, later setting her up as &#8220;Money Honey&#8221; to exchange the currency, U.S. court papers reveal.</p>
    <p>Nearly two years ago, police found Webster in the Beaverton Hilton Garden in possession of an ounce of meth, $2,320 in cash, a digital scale, used syringes, a cellphone and a computer – all part of what government prosecutors described as a meth distribution hub.</p>
    <p>Hagen&#8217;s His crew made 3,169 sales, with purchasers across North America and in Australia, Italy, the U.K., Czech Republic and other nations, according to court documents.</p>
