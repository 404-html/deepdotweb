Police are currently crawling through the man’s computer trying to find more child pornography material.</p>
<p>Daldorph spent 14 years of his life collecting the child porn images and videos from different dark web sites. The man was arrested in April after law enforcement authorities searched his home and found a number of devices containing images of children as young as two. According to the police, one of the hard drives, which Daldorph had previously encrypted, was found to contain 1.8 terabytes of footage data, the equivalent of around 3,000 full-length feature films.</p>
<p>According to the NCA, this is the biggest child porn bust in history. The material the law enforcement authorities have collected from Daldorph contained thousands of Category A abuse images and videos, which is said to be the most extreme kind of all. After the man admitted his crimes and officers searched his house, police have found several laptops, hard drives and USB&#8217;s containing illicit child porn images and videos. The man assisted the police and provided passwords to all his devices.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Mercer QC, after sentencing the man to 2 years and 4 four months of prison time, made this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;For over 14 years as you admit, you have regularly set time aside to scour the darkest corners of the web to find some of the more disturbing representations of child abuse available. This is &#8211; in my judgement &#8211; an extreme case of downloading indecent photographs of children. It&#8217;s an extreme case because of the volume of the material which you downloaded over a substantial time and it&#8217;s an extreme case by reference of nature of the material which is found and described and documented before me. Your obsession with it causes the court great concern. What you did, as I hope you understand, encourages and supports the quite terrible abuse of children.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Robert Duval, defending Daldorph, the man suffered from asthma as a child and was bullied by his schoolmates, that’s why he developed this kind of “obsession” of his. Duval also said that his defendant also had &#8220;limited sexual experiences of his own&#8221; and he did not meet his wife (who was present in court) until his age of 27. The court also heard that Daldorph there’s no evidence that the man was engaged in any kinds of children offending.</p>
<p>The former hospital radiographer pleaded guilty to nine child porn related charges and one count of possessing extreme pornography.</p>
<p>Christian Hall, NCA investigator leading the case against Daldorph, made this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Daldorph was responsible for amassing hundreds of thousands of indecent images, some of them the most extreme possible involving very young children. Each of those involved a child being abused in some of the worst ways imaginable. While we have no evidence to show he committed any contact offences himself, what he has done has perpetuated demand for products that can only be produced through the abuse of children.&#8221;</p>
