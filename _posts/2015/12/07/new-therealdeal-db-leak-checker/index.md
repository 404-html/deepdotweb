<p>New service launched by <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/therealdeal-market/">TheRealDeal</a> Team, as it was described by their admin:</p>
<p>Available at this URL: <strong>http://leakdbxhumhnzsa7.onion</strong></p>
<p>Our DB leak checking service service allows anyone to check whether the databases or other kind of information that they are about to purchase on the our market, or any other market for that matter, is part of the public domain and has already been leaked for free.</p>
<p>For example, if one was to plan on purchasing a database and ask for a sample, he might end up with a few entries which would include a username, password, email, etc&#8230; One could take a unique fraction of this information, for example a password hash 79e846c1c4eab84db5e15e824afab256 and search for it using our service – if there is a match, you will know what database it has been taken from and what other information is associated with it, and therefor get a pretty good idea if what you are about to buy is worth the money.</p>
<p>I should also mention that this is not the only use for such a large database of logins, one could easily target a person who uses the same password all the time by searching for his email ;)</p>
<p>Our databases also consist of semi-private and easily hacked databases which have been sold on the darknet and/or clearnet – so one could tell if the money he is about to pay actually worth what he gets in return. As to the “easily hacked” part – our servers are constantly crawling websites using public, private and general purpose exploits and bugs in attempt to extract and dump databases from websites, web applications and database applications like loosely secured mysql, mssql, oracle, firebird etc&#8230;</p>
<p>At the current stage (beta) &#8211; Anyone can sign up for free and get full results limited to the 20 first matches found, showing all the information related to their query and the name of the database it was found in.</p>
<p>In the near future we will allow &#8216;guests&#8217; to only see if we found a match and the in which database it was found, while offering premium memberships which will allow a user to view more results or all the matching results found from all the databases, depending on their membership package. We are also planning on selling the databases directly for a fairly cheap price and in automated manner.</p>

<p>At the time of writing there are currently over 300,000,000 entries (and counting), mostly login information from 1000s of different databases, we plan on adding another 200,000,000 later on today, and of course more as time goes by and databases are leaked, offered for sale, and crawled/dumped.</p>
<p>I would like to personally thank our co-admin “peace” for setting this up and gathering all the databases one could possibly think of, and even not think of :)<br/>
    We hope you enjoy our services, TheRealDeal Market</p>
<p><strong>What are the future costs?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have not determined the costs yet, but the packages will either be &#8220;lifetime access&#8221; or on a monthly basis, if the latter, then somewhere around $20.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it better than other services?</strong></p>
<p>It is better because first of all searching is anonymous, other than that you get the FULL information and source name, and the option to buy the databases. On top of that our sources are unique and we are using both public and private exploits to collect data from databases all over the internet.</p>
<p>I think its the only site that actually lets you look at the information from, for example, ashley madison, and not just &#8220;check&#8221; if an email is in the list, but also view the full information of the person.</p>
