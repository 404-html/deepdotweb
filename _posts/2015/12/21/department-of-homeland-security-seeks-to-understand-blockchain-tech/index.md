    <p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/department-of-homeland-security-calls-for-blockchain-research/">The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is launching a program where they are exploring ways to understand the blockchain technology better.</a> They do this within their Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) of the department’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.</p>
    <p>The DHS is currently accepting research proposals from small businesses in 13 different topic areas, including the &#8220;Applicability of Blockchain Technology to Privacy Respecting Identity Management&#8221; and &#8220;Blockchain Applications for Homeland Security Analytics&#8221;. They describe their project as a ”three-phase program” that encourages small businesses to work and do their research with the federal agency. The SBIR project firstly seeks to assess the &#8220;technical merit and feasibility&#8221; of the submitted proposals by the small firms. DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology, Reginald Brothers, made this statement about the program:</p>
    <p>&#8220;It is vitally important that we cast a wide net to find highly innovative solutions to the nation&#8217;s homeland security challenges. We know that America&#8217;s small businesses are creative problem solvers and engines of innovation and we want to hear from them.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The proposals approved for Phase I are limited to six months and are awarded the sum of $100,000 while projects that pass to Phase II are eligible for 24-month projects with up to $750,000 available in the form of awards.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR program,&#8221; the Department of Homeland Security stated.</p>
    <p>In the S&amp;T initiative, the Homeland Security is calling a research for 10 projects, including the ”studying malware prediction for cyber defense” and ”real-time data analytics for emergency medical services.” The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office program of the DHS also offers grants in three different categories.</p>
    <p>Proposals should be submitted to the DHS SBIR by 14:00 EST on January 20, 2016, in order to be considered for 2016&#8217;s project.</p>
