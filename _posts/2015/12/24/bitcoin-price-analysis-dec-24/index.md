    <p>Over the past 2 weeks, bitcoin price went up from a low retracement bottom at $ 346, going up to $ 467, attempting to touch last month’s $ 504 high. This rise up has been anything but momentous, especially compared to the run up to $ 502. Low volumes have accompanied this rise up. At current price levels, the trend has hit a resistance level at $467</p>
    <p><em>“resistance at the ¥3,000 ($465) level. If it holds, we could be retracing to 2,000 yuan ($310)”</em></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/23.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12740" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/23.jpg" alt="2" width="1612" height="944" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/23.jpg 1612w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/23-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/23-1024x600.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1612px) 100vw, 1612px"/></a></p>
    <p>Here we see the move up from August at $ 198 to $ 502 was huge with no retracements, it was only a matter of time before it retraced. Since the peak, the market retraced the whole move up, then found a bottom at $ 320; this second attempt at maintaining the trend has met resistance. Low volumes highlighted also emphasise this.</p>
    <p>This pattern looks eerily similar to January &#8211; February 2015.</p>
    <p><em>“Possible fractal in play #BTC”</em></p>

    <p>If this plays out, lower prices are on the horizon.</p>
    <p>Looking back at an elliott wave chart I posted in one of my analyses in July, a bearish outlook is not far fetched. This was before events over the past 6 months</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/41.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12742" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/41.png" alt="4" width="1916" height="878" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/41.png 1916w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/41-300x137.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/41-1024x469.png 1024w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/41-272x125.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 1916px) 100vw, 1916px"/></a></p>
    <p>Here is an updated chart of the same</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/51.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12743" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/51.png" alt="5" width="1912" height="897" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/51.png 1912w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/51-300x141.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/51-1024x480.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1912px) 100vw, 1912px"/></a></p>
    <p>It seems we are on the edge of a cliff. Price was expected to find a top in the range between $450 and $ 700, and then head back down to retest lows. It is an option I am open to, and keeping an eye on.</p>
    <p><em>“the time I have drawn in for the C is not a requirement, nor is the depth. It could be something that plays out in just a few months. and even makes a higher low as a failed C. The chart depicts a textbook structure”</em></p>
    <p><strong>Record Highs Predicted after 2016 Supply Halving &#8211; Reuters</strong></p>
    <p>This week, Reuters ran a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin-analysis-idUSKBN0U60GM20151223">piece</a> on possible price projections in 2016 and 2017, some of it expected to be heavily influenced by the much anticipated block reward halving in June 2016; from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC per block for miners.</p>
    <p><em>“But taken in isolation, the halving of the mining reward will increase the price of bitcoin by around 50 percent from where it is now”</em></p>
    <p>Daniel Masters, co-founder of Jersey-based Global Advisors&#8217; multi-million dollar bitcoin hedge fund spoke to Reuters</p>
    <p>“<em>Now he reckons the price of bitcoin could test its 2013 highs of above $1,100 next year and then pick up speed to rise to $4,400 by the end of 2017.”</em></p>
    <p>Certainly a bold prediction, one that chimes with what I periodically reiterate in my analyses. $ 5 billion market is too small for the potential of bitcoin as an alternative asset class in a period of economic fiat crisis.</p>
    <p><strong>Tuur Demeester on Bitcoin price prediction</strong></p>
    <p>A liberty entrepreneurs <a href="http://libertyentrepreneurs.com/2015/12/episode-9-tuur-demeester/">podcast</a> featuring Tuur Demeester is well worth a listen. Tuur, an Austrian economist, investor and founder of Adamant research shares his thoughts on BTC price forecast, strategy for investing and opinion on bitcoin development.</p>
    <p><strong>16:14</strong> How should you think about investing in the bitcoin space? Tuur has three words for you. “Buy and Hold”.</p>
    <p><strong>18:15</strong> <strong>“</strong>Somewhere in the next two years, there is going to be a panic, and bitcoin is going to benefit from that.”</p>
    <p><strong>Trace Mayer &#8211; The Rise of the Fourth Great Bitcoin Bubble</strong></p>
    <p>Another vocal pundit and investor in this space. In his <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2015/12/the-rise-of-the-fourth-great-bitcoin-bubble/">piece</a>,Trace talks about the forthcoming bubble, reminiscent of previous ones. While he does not pin down a date or number, he recommends a buy and hold strategy too.</p>
    <p><em>“The bear market of the past two years has been brutal, hard, necessary and good. But now it is time to strap in!”</em></p>
    <p><strong>SIDENOTE</strong></p>
    <p>If you are keen, themes predicting an upcoming swing in price, are emerging frequently, from pundits in the space. A lot of emphasis on 2017/2018 and the 2 &#8211; 3 year timeline. At this point, I recommend strategic buys at favorable prices and plan to hold for the next 3 years. Remember to only risk what you can afford to lose.</p>
    <p>In all this, observing bitcoin development is <u>absolutely necessary</u>, particularly scaling bitcoin and security. While there are some promising proposals and expected products that will help achieve this eg Segregated Witness, BIPs, Lightning Network, Sidechains , none is concrete as yet. Scaling bitcoin directly affects its price and adoption &#8211; especially in the event of a bubble. I am not expecting another bubble until this matter is resolved.</p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin Weekly Price Forecast</strong></p>
    <p>This week, I am bearish and expecting prices to head back down to $ 400, possibly as low as $ 350. This week’s pattern is a triangle &#8211; that looks ripe to break. Triangle patterns are fairly common in bitcoin charts, and are always terminal, resulting in a break out &#8211; either up or down.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12744" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/6.jpg" alt="6" width="1600" height="751" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/6.jpg 1600w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/6-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/6-1024x481.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></a></p>
    <p>While it could break either up or down, as per this chart, my bias is bearish down.</p>
