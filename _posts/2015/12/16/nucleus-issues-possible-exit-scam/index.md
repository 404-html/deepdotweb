    <p><strong>#4th Update on Nucleus</strong>: Seems to be back up: <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/nucleus-market/">Nucleus Market</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>#3rd Update on Nucleus</strong>: &#8220;We have answered some questions about unaccessible accounts on the Support, but server will stay offline for next 5 &#8211; 9 hours due to preparations for relaunch.&#8221;</p>
    <p><strong>#2nd Update on <strong>Nucleus</strong></strong>: &#8220;We are still investigating the problem. Server should be back online yesterday.&#8221;</p>
    <p><strong>Update on Nucleus</strong> <strong>homepage</strong>&#8211; Please hold until everything is confirmed as fixed (if at all):</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nucleus.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12588" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nucleus.png" alt="nucleus" width="986" height="556" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nucleus.png 986w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nucleus-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px"/></a></p>
    <p>======End of update====</p>
    <p>During the past 24 hours we had multiple reports from vendors being locked out of their accounts on nucleus market, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/16/solved-these-are-the-most-popular-dark-net-markets/">which is (or was?) the second largest market currently</a>, there reports were posted on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/nucleus-market/">Nucleus listing here</a> and on several Reddit threads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3x1a5r/nucleus_exit_scam_do_not_use_mods_add_this_to_the/">such as this one</a>.Â  During this time buyer withdrawals seemed to be unaffected. Currently the market seems to be down:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nuc.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12580" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nuc.png" alt="nuc" width="677" height="133" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nuc.png 677w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nuc-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px"/></a></p>
    <p>It is not yet clear if this is yet another (totally unsurprising) exit scam in our even growing list of exit scammers or some technical issue. We&#8217;ll be following and updating when / if we will have any new info. So far there were no reported updates from the admins.</p>
    <p>Either way, if it goes back up &#8211; you should avoid any deposits to the market until the issues with the locked out vendors are cleared.</p>
    <p>Until then, remember, exit scams are part of the dark net markets game, here are some alternatives:</p>
    <ul>
    <li class="ok"><strong><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay/">AlphaBay</a></strong></li>

    <li class="ok"><strong><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/outlaw-market/"> Outlaw Market</a></strong></li>
    <li class="ok"><strong><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/silkkitie/">Valhalla (Silkkitie)</a></strong></li>

    <li class="ok"><strong><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/acas-market/">ACAS Market</a></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currently uptime issues are also being reported on Cryuserv which is hosting several vendor shops.</p>
    <p>Since Agora was shut down, it became the season of exit scams when, as expected, the next &#8220;default&#8221; markets in line took advantage of the massive agora refugees traffic and exit scammed. So far we had Abraxas and middle earth, maybe now Nucleus? who will be next&#8230; only time will tell.</p>
