    <div class="entry">
    <p>For some time now, we have been hearing a lot of good things about <a href="http://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=121&amp;aff_id=1758&amp;url_id=433&amp;aff_sub=NordDDWRev" target="_blank">NordVPN</a>. And because of this, we have decided to conduct a comprehensive review of their <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/vpn-comparison-chart/" target="_blank">VPN features and services</a>, so that we can determine if the title “The world’s most advanced VPN” really applies to them.</p>
    <p>To kick off with the review, here are several helpful information that you can use to get an idea about their company.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image0012.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12635" src="/imgs/2015/12/image0012.jpg" alt="image001" width="623" height="422" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image0012.jpg 623w, /imgs/2015/12/image0012-300x203.jpg 300w, /imgs/2015/12/image0012-290x195.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></a></p>
    <h3>About the Company</h3>
    <p>NordVPN is a Panama based company that is owned and operated by Tefincom co S.A. The company was established in 2008 as a respond to the high demands for a reliable VPN service connection during that time.</p>
    <p>Today, NordVPN provides its users with a secure and protected gateway to the Internet using their 108 VPN servers that are spread across 24 countries worldwide, which includes The United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Lithuania, Netherlands, Sweden, Brazil, South Africa, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Australia, Switzerland, Israel, Poland, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Japan, Austria and Luxembourg.</p>
    <h2>Free Trial and Money Back Guarantee Policy –NordVPN</h2>
    <p>NordVPN offers a 3 days free trial access to their VPN services, so that potential users can test their features and services before purchasing any of their VPN plans and packages. However, you need to send an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e89b9d9898879a9ca886879a8c9e9886c68b8785">[email&#160;protected]</a> or you can alternatively contact their customer support via their online chat before you can get access to the free trial account.</p>
    <p><a href="http://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=121&amp;aff_id=1758&amp;url_id=433&amp;aff_sub=NordDDWRev" target="_blank"><strong>&gt;&gt; Click HERE to Visit the NordVPN Official Site</strong></a></p>
    <p>For this review, we opted to request access to their free trial account via their online chat.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12636" src="/imgs/2015/12/image002.jpg" alt="image002" width="560" height="297" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image002.jpg 560w, /imgs/2015/12/image002-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
    <p>We were able to get a reply within a minute, instructing us to register an account at a URL that they sent us. We followed the instructions given to us and selected Bitcoin as the mode of payment.</p>
    <p>After registering the account, we sent the email address that we have used to register to the customer support representative that we are chatting with. After a couple of minutes, we received a reply from the customer support representative, informing us that our free trial account has been activated.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image0031.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12637" src="/imgs/2015/12/image0031.jpg" alt="image003" width="361" height="419" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image0031.jpg 361w, /imgs/2015/12/image0031-258x300.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></a></p>
    <p>We clicked on the profile link given in the chat screen and we were able to see the confirmation of the activation of our free trial account.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image004.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12638" src="/imgs/2015/12/image004.jpg" alt="image004" width="624" height="288" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image004.jpg 624w, /imgs/2015/12/image004-300x138.jpg 300w, /imgs/2015/12/image004-272x125.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
    <p>Registering for the free trial account was quick and easy. The customer support representative that we have chatted with replied fast and was very helpful.</p>
    <p>In addition to the free trial access that NordVPN offers, they also provides a 30 days money back guarantee to all customer accounts that are in good standing. Unfortunately, those that purchased their account through the Apple appstore and those that paid using Bitcoin are not eligible for any refunds.</p>
    <h2>Interface and Setup &#8211; NordVPN</h2>
    <p>After getting our free trial account, we followed the advice of the customer support representative that we have chatted with and downloaded the custom software for their VPN client.</p>
    <p>On our profile page, we clicked on the Download area tab and selected their client software for Windows 8.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image0051.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12639" src="/imgs/2015/12/image0051.jpg" alt="image005" width="624" height="318" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image0051.jpg 624w, /imgs/2015/12/image0051-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
    <p>We waited for the client software download to finish and then ran the program to install the NordVPN software.</p>
    <p>We were expecting the file that we have download to install the software, but we were surprised to see the login screen immediately after running the program.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image006.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12640" src="/imgs/2015/12/image006.jpg" alt="image006" width="296" height="408" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image006.jpg 296w, /imgs/2015/12/image006-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></a></p>
    <p>We entered our username and password and then clicked on the Log in button.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image0071.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12641" src="/imgs/2015/12/image0071.jpg" alt="image007" width="324" height="383" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image0071.jpg 324w, /imgs/2015/12/image0071-254x300.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></a></p>
    <p>After a few seconds of loading, we were directed to their server list, where we can choose the VPN server that we want to use to connect to their VPN service.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image008.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12642" src="/imgs/2015/12/image008.jpg" alt="image008" width="311" height="554" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image008.jpg 311w, /imgs/2015/12/image008-168x300.jpg 168w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /></a></p>
    <p>We opted for one of their standard VPN servers (Canada #4) and then clicked on the Connect button. We then waited for the VPN client software to connect.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image0091.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12643" src="/imgs/2015/12/image0091.jpg" alt="image009" width="309" height="173" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image0091.jpg 309w, /imgs/2015/12/image0091-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /></a></p>
    <p>After a few seconds, it directed us to the connection screen and informed as that we were successfully able to connect to our selected VPN server.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image010.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12644" src="/imgs/2015/12/image010.jpg" alt="image010" width="324" height="378" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image010.jpg 324w, /imgs/2015/12/image010-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></a></p>
    <p>To sum it up, NordVPN’s client software was wonderful. It didn’t even require any installation process after we have downloaded the software from their website.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image0112.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12645" src="/imgs/2015/12/image0112.jpg" alt="image011" width="332" height="341" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image0112.jpg 332w, /imgs/2015/12/image0112-292x300.jpg 292w, /imgs/2015/12/image0112-55x55.jpg 55w, /imgs/2015/12/image0112-50x50.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" /></a></p>
    <p>Furthermore, it provides a process kill list feature that automatically closes any program that you setup, whenever your VPN connection is accidentally disconnected. This added feature provides you with extra online protection every time that you surf the net.</p>
    <h2>Security –NordVPN</h2>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image012.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12646" src="/imgs/2015/12/image012.jpg" alt="image012" width="624" height="162" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image012.jpg 624w, /imgs/2015/12/image012-300x78.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
    <p>NordVPN boast of having the most advanced VPN service in the market today. They offer multiple protocols access that uses a military grade AES 256 encryption for L2TP/IPSEC protocol, 2048 bit SSL encryption for OpenVPN protocol and MPPE-128 bit encryption for PPTP.</p>
    <p>In addition to these protocols, they also support TOR and SOCKS, and they offer a unique double encryption system that uses two node servers to protect their user’s online data.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, they also provide HTTP and Socks5 proxies to their subscribers.</p>
    <h2>Privacy -NordVPN</h2>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image0131.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12647" src="/imgs/2015/12/image0131.jpg" alt="image013" width="624" height="134" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image0131.jpg 624w, /imgs/2015/12/image0131-300x64.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
    <p>In terms of privacy, NordVPN is one of the few companies that are on the top of the list. They do not keep, monitor, or store any time stamps, bandwidth usage, traffic logs, IP addresses or any other kind of log records. This is especially good if using NordVPN to get maximum privacy with Tor when on the Deep Web.</p>
    <p>They also do not provide any personal information about their subscribers, except when a court order of competent jurisdiction is involved, which would be rare because the company is registered in Panama, which is outside the U.S. and EU jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, they do keep several information about their subscribers, such as the email address and username that was used to register for the account, and the payment information that they keep records in case of request for refunds.</p>
    <p>Moreover, NordVPN does not provide any Transparency Reports that could help alert users of any claims and disputes that were filled against them, which would be helpful in further protecting their user’s privacy and anonymity.</p>

    <h2>Speed – NordVPN</h2>
    <p>During the speed tests NordVPN performed lower than average. Based on the results there was a considerable drop in download speed when connected to NordVPN’s VPN service.</p>
    <p>Even though, a speed drop is expected when connecting to a VPN, our test indicates that it is a little bit slower than other VPN service providers in the market today. But of course, the results varies from one VPN server to another. Full comparative speed tests to come in the new year.</p>
    <h2>Usability – NordVPN</h2>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2015/12/image014.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12648" src="/imgs/2015/12/image014.jpg" alt="image014" width="624" height="344" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image014.jpg 624w, /imgs/2015/12/image014-300x165.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
    <p>Using NordVPN is amazingly fast and simple. Their VPN software is so easy to use and understand. We encountered no complex procedures when connecting to any of their VPN servers. Moreover, there are no installation required, you just have to download their client software and you are ready to go.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, NordVPN allows users to connect up to 6 devices per account to their VPN network at the same time. This generous number is more than enough for users to connect all their gadgets to the VPN network with just one account, allowing the whole family to enjoy the privacy and security that NordVPN provides.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion – NordVPN</h2>
    <p>NordVPN is really a good VPN service provider. Their service is packed with multiple features that further enhance the security and privacy of their online users. Furthermore, their customer support is world class and reliable.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, their connection speed is below average, and they have a limited number of accepted payment method options.</p>
    <p>Overall, NordVPN is recommended for those who prefer 1<sup>st</sup> rate VPN privacy and security over the speed of their online connections.</p>
