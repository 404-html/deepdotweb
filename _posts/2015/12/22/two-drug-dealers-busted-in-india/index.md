<p>According to the Times of India, earlier this week, the local police has arrested the associates of the two drug dealers, Mustafa Mohiuddin (27), Junaid Raza Siddiqui (25) and Md Manzil Mukarram Pasha (26).

<p>According to police information, the Sahu brothers after buying the drugs from the dark web contacted Mustafa Mohiuddin in order to market and sell the illegal substances. Around a week ago, the brothers provided Mohiuddin 45 LSD blotter and a few grams of ephedrine to be sold.
