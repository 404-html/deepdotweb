<p>To begin the review, let us take a look at some of the information and facts that we have gathered about their company.</p>
<h3>About the Company</h3>
<p>HideIPVPN is a company that aims to provide users around the world with an affordable and first class VPN and SmartDNS service. Their company was established on September 2009 by its CEO and founder Adrian Crismaru. Their objective was to provide a way for all people to have access to a strong online protection, so that everyone can enjoy the freedom to express themselves on the internet.</p>
<p>HideIPVPN is made up of 9 VPN servers in the US, 8 VPN servers in the UK, 5 VPN servers in Netherlands, 3 VPN servers in Germany, 2 VPN servers in Canada and 1 VPN server in Poland.</p>
<p>At present, the company conducts their operations at their head office located at 1201 N Orange St Wilmington, Delaware in the USA.</p>
<h2>Free Trial and Money Back Guarantee Policy –HideIPVPN</h2>

This onetime, limited free trial offer allows users to connect to all HideIVPN servers in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>Additionally, they also offer a 7 days Free SmartDNS access on their premium servers and a 30 days money back guarantee on all new subscriptions. However, they do not process any refunds on speed issues, because their free trial service already allows users to test the speed of their VPN service before purchasing any subscription plans and packages.</p>

<h2>Interface and Setup &#8211; HideIPVPN</h2>
<p>HideIPVPN’s client software is easy to download and install. You can access their client software installer through the link button that they include in the email notification that they send when you register for their free trial service, or you can download it by clicking on the Support tab on their website.</p>
<h3>Downloading and Installing the HideIPVPN Software</h3>
<p>For this review, we used a device running on Windows platform and opted to download their VPN software through their website.</p>
<p>After choosing the HideIPVPN Software tab on their support page, we clicked on the DOWNLOAD button and waited for the download process to finish.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12428" src="/imgs/2015/12/image007.jpg" alt="image007" width="804" height="597" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image007.jpg 804w, /imgs/2015/12/image007-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /></p>
<p>After the download was complete, we ran the software installer and clicked on the Next button, and then the I Agree button to start the installation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12429" src="/imgs/2015/12/image009.jpg" alt="image009" width="509" height="397" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image009.jpg 509w, /imgs/2015/12/image009-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /></p>
<p>We selected which components to install and then clicked on the Next button.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12430" src="/imgs/2015/12/image011.jpg" alt="image011" width="509" height="397" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image011.jpg 509w, /imgs/2015/12/image011-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /></p>
<p>We entered the destination folder where the files would be saved and then clicked on the Install button.</p>
<p>The software installed the initial files and then displayed a dialogue box that asked us if we wanted to install TAP-Windows Provider V9 Network adapter. We clicked on the install button to proceed with the installation. We waited for the setup process to end and then we clicked on the Finish button to complete the installation.</p>
<h3>Connecting to the HideIPVPN network</h3>
<p>After the setup process was complete, their software automatically ran and displayed their VPN login screen in our device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12431" src="/imgs/2015/12/image013.jpg" alt="image013" width="473" height="452" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image013.jpg 473w, /imgs/2015/12/image013-300x287.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>We entered our username and password on the fields provided and then clicked on the SIGN IN button to continue.</p>
<p>We were directed to their VPN connection screen, where we selected the protocol and the VPN server that we wanted to connect to on their VPN network.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12432" src="/imgs/2015/12/image015.jpg" alt="image015" width="476" height="452" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image015.jpg 476w, /imgs/2015/12/image015-300x285.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></p>
<p>We clicked on the CONNECT button and waited for the software to connect us to the VPN network.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12433" src="/imgs/2015/12/image017.jpg" alt="image017" width="477" height="452" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image017.jpg 477w, /imgs/2015/12/image017-300x284.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>After a few seconds, the status was changed to Connected, informing us that we were able to successfully connect to their VPN service.</p>
<p>HideIPVPN’s client software is so easy to use. It even allowed us to change our preferred network settings and use their Application Killer feature quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12434" src="/imgs/2015/12/image019.jpg" alt="image019" width="474" height="452" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image019.jpg 474w, /imgs/2015/12/image019-300x286.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12435" src="/imgs/2015/12/image021.jpg" alt="image021" width="473" height="452" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image021.jpg 473w, /imgs/2015/12/image021-300x287.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<h2>Security –HideIPVPN</h2>
<p>HideIPVPN protects its subscribers by allowing them to use any of the multiple encryption protocols that they provide in their VPN service, which includes OpenVPN (128-bit encryption), SSTP (256-bit encryption), L2TP/IPSec (256-bit encryption), PPTP (128-bit encryption) and SoftEther (128-bit encryption).</p>
<p>The variety of the protocols that HideIPVPN offers to their users allows their VPN service to be flexible against different security threats and attacks, making them one of the most secured VPN service providers in the market today.</p>
<h3>Privacy –HideIPVPN</h3>
<p>HideIPVPN does not keep any server log records. However, they do store the name, billing details and other personally identifiable information of their users. Plus, they may request a proof of identity from users that are suspicious or those that register from high risk countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, HideIPVPN is based in the US, which is under the DCMA jurisdiction. This makes it harder to avoid any DCMA claims and disputes.</p>
<p>Moreover, they do not provide any Transparency Reports that may warn their users of any complains that were made against them.</p>

<h2>Speed – HideIPVPN</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12436" src="/imgs/2015/12/image023.jpg" alt="image023" width="707" height="394" srcset="/imgs/2015/12/image023.jpg 707w, /imgs/2015/12/image023-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" /></p>
<p>During our speed test review for HideIPVPN, we didn’t notice any lags and latency issues on their network. In fact, HideIPVPN did better that most VPN service providers out there in the market today, because during our entire speed test review on their network, they only averaged a 7% drop on speed, which is quite good in terms of VPN connection speed.</p>
<h2>Usability – HideIPVPN</h2>
<p>Overall, HideIPVPN gets an A grade from us in terms of usability. Everything is done fast and easily. Downloading and installing HideIPVPN’s client software is a breeze. Their website even provides a step by step instruction on how to setup and install their client software.</p>
<p>Furthermore, HideIPVPN allows you to connect up to 3 devices on their network simultaneously. Plus, their Application Killer feature provides users with the peace of mind that they need, because it can automatically close selected applications whenever their VPN connection is accidentally disconnected.</p>
<p>Though, we have observed one negative aspect about their VPN network, which is the limited number of VPN servers available. It would have been great, if there were more location options to connect to.</p>

<p>For this review, we tried to test their chat support and got a response within 30 seconds, which is very impressive.</p>
<h2>Conclusion – HideIPVPN</h2>
<p>HideIPVPN is one of the most reliable VPN service providers in the market in terms of security and speed. They provide fast and secured VPN connections at an affordable price.</p>
<p>On the other hand, their limited number of VPN servers and a vague privacy policy lowers the quality of their VPN service somewhat.</p>
<p>To sum it up, HideIPVPN is a middle range option to protect your privacy and anonymity while online. If you are an avid user of the darknet marketplaces and this is to be used along with Tor to increase your privacy and security then you may want to consider looking at the providers at the top of the VPN Review Chart.</p>
