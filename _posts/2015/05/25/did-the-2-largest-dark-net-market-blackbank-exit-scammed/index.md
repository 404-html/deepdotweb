<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="/2015/06/15/blackbank-exit-scam-confirmed/">The exit scam is now confirmed.</a></p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/black-bank-bitcoin-market" target="_blank">BlackBank market</a>, one of the 3 current leading markets has been down for the past week or so for &#8220;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackBank/comments/36r0oq/update_over_market_maintenance/" target="_blank">security maintenance</a>&#8221; (Does implementing a tumbler ring any sheep bells?)</p>
<p>The most recent news posted on Blackbanks&#8217; sub Reddit by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/blackbank_team" target="_blank">blackbank_team</a>, one of the market support staffer, seems to indicate that the admin, MDparity is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackBank/comments/36r0oq/update_over_market_maintenance/" target="_blank">no longer communicating</a>, a strong indicator that this might be another exit scam in a long line of markets who decided to vanish with their users funds &#8211; with <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/18/evolution-marketplace-exit-scam-biggest-exist-scam-ever/" target="_blank">evolution</a> being the biggest so far, this is the Reddit thread posted by the support staffer:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know, you&#8217;re afraid and i&#8217;m afraid too that mdparity will never ever come back</p>
<p>But to answer all of your questions</p>
<p>My messages here aren&#8217;t usually pgp signed, but there are only 2 persons who have credentials for this profile</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe mdparity has decided to exit scam now, if he has done it i&#8217;m astonished, but i believe he hasn&#8217;t done it, some might have happened to him, since he&#8217;s not answering my messages</p>
<p>I will give him until the first day of june before declaring BlackBank dead, so let&#8217;s wait toghether</p>

<p>Since many markets are currently experiencing <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/05/11/this-is-the-ransom-ddos-that-is-hitting-the-dark-net-markets/" target="_blank">Ddo&#8217;s attacks</a> and are currently down, it might be an easy opportunity for market admins to disappear without anyone noticing until its too late.</p>
<p>To be clear &#8211; this is not a confirmed exit scammed, but it sure starting to look like one, so we will be following and updating.</p>
