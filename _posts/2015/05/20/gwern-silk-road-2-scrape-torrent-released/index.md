<p>On This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/36jmp2/silk_road_2_scrape_torrent_released/">Reddit thread</a> by <a href="http://www.gwern.net/">Gwern</a>:</p>
<div class="usertext-body may-blank-within md-container ">
<div class="md">
<blockquote><p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gwern-blackmarkets/silkroad2.tar.xz?torrent">Torrent file</a>; this is a 3.4GB XZ-compressed tarball containing ~57 partial wget mirrors of Silk Road 2 ranging from 2013-12-20 to 2014-11-06, of &gt;800k files/35GB. Contains mostly HTML and images encoded as CSS (which was just how SR2 did things). Note that few or non of these crawls are <em>complete</em> because SR2 was large, slow, had occasional downtime, Tor occasionally times out, and sometimes spammers like Profesor_house choked the listings. Caveat emptor.</p>

<p>I am releasing this for research purposes. If you do anything interesting with it, I would appreciate you leaving a comment or contacting me about it.</p>
