    <p>Since <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/18/evolution-marketplace-exit-scam-biggest-exist-scam-ever/">evolution exit scammed</a> &#8211; The new <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay">AlphaBay</a> market seem to have taken the lead as the leading market for fraud related items such as stolen credit cards and other types of personal data and hacked databases. Few days ago, they seem to have taken this one step even further by releasing a fully automated shop for &#8220;fulls&#8221; or credit cards using filters for the users &#8220;convenience&#8221; to help them find the card of their choice by &#8211; <span class="std">BIN, </span><span class="std">Exp, </span><span class="std">Seller, </span><span class="std">Name, </span><span class="std">City, </span><span class="std">State, </span><span class="std">Zip, </span><span class="std">Country, </span><span class="std">DOB, </span><span class="std">SSN or </span><span class="std">Price, as we have seen before in some other carding shops but never before on a DNM. The cards are being sold at a cheap price tag. As their official announcement states:<br />
    </span></p>
    <blockquote><p>We now have a fully-functional autoshop for all members looking to buy fulls or credit cards! The link is on the top-left of the page. You can search by DOB, BIN, city, state, and much more. The process is completely automated. All cards are dispatched immediately, and the funds are released to the vendor 30 minutes later. We also added support for Jabber notifications when an order is placed so you stay alerted at all times.</p></blockquote>
    <p>Picture of the automated shop:<a href="/imgs/2015/05/ccautoshop2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10362" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ccautoshop2.png" alt="ccautoshop2" width="1063" height="815" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ccautoshop2.png 1063w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ccautoshop2-300x230.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ccautoshop2-1024x785.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px" /></a></p>
    <p>Not only that, but one of <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay">AlphaBay</a> admins told DeepDotWeb at a private chat session that they are planning to launch a similar automatic shop for hacked and stolen accounts:</p>
    <blockquote><p>like facebook, gmail, bank logins, whatever you imagine!</p></blockquote>
    <p>Its pretty safe to assume that all the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/05/11/this-is-the-ransom-ddos-that-is-hitting-the-dark-net-markets/">recent Ddo&#8217;s attacks</a> are not doing a very good job at crippling the growing trade volume on the Dark Net Markets, or hold admin back from releasing new features for their target audience, we will keep following and updating.</p>
