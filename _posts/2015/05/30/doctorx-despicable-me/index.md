    <p>A Post by Fernando Caudevilla &#8211; better known as <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=doctorx">DoctorX</a>, the doctor who provided harm reduction advice on Silk Road, originally posted on <a href="http://elsubmarinodeldoctorx.com/2015/05/30/despicable-me/">his blog</a> and share to his request:</p>
    <p>After being declared guilty, Ross Ulbritch has been sentenced to life in prison as mastermind of Silk Road. Judge has dismissed all arguments about harm reduction. Also, I has been considered as “particularly despicable” and “irresponsible”.</p>
    <p>Ross Ulbritch was sentenced yesterday to life imprisonment as mastermind of Silk Road. In this story there are involved murder-for-hire accusations without body of evidence and FBI agents jailed and accused of extortion and stealing money from the investigation. Judge has not considered relevant the testimony of a group of professionals who had been monitoring and working in Deep Web Marketplaces, in which it was included my work as medical assessor in harm reduction for drug users.</p>
    <p>I have no legal knowledge to evaluate the case. The judge has legal authority to consider our testimony not relevant and deliver a verdict.</p>
    <p>But this morning I have woke up with this tweet and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/05/29/ulbricht-silk-road-sentencing/28072247/">this news </a>in which the judge considers me an “enabler,” and my behavior “breathtakingly irresponsible.”</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Judge called the harm reduction argument nonsense, called Dr. X &quot;particularly despicable&quot; and &quot;irresponsible&quot;</p>

    <p>In the following link you can find most of my work in Silk Road Forum from April to October 2013:</p>

    <p>There are some missing private messages. For example, the case of a heroin addict who suffered a leukaemia but was wrongly diagnosed with withdrawal syndrome (related in Silk Road book by Eileen Ormsby) or another heroin user (Trust in Me) whose girlfriend suffered an overdose while I was online and was suggested to use intranasal naloxone as a emergency measure (<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/fernando-caudevilla-spanish-doctor-advises-drug-users-on-the--dark-webs-silk-road-20141020-118lfi.html">HERE</a> is the whole story)</p>
    <p>I don´t know the legal basis used by judge to describe me with those adjectives. I am not qualified to evaluate her professionally but I doubt judge Katherine Forrest has understood what does harm reduction mean.</p>
    <p>I received donations from Dread Pirate Roberts, as many other anonymous users who financed a harm reduction work to which I dedicated between two and three hours a day. I declared this free and voluntarily because I have nothing to hide and my personal identity and work has been public in every moment. And I thought this aspect should be considered in the trial.</p>
    <p>Probably there were other more adequate ways of funding. Unfortunately, money assigned to drug prevention is mostly wasted in ineffective, fear-based prevention campaigns. People working in harm reduction field generally work on activism,  for free or in precarious conditions. In any case I have been working in harm reduction for the last fifteen years , I am proud about my work and I think to continue on it</p>
