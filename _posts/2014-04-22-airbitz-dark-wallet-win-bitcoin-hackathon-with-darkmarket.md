<p><strong> Reddit discution: http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/23m79j/darkmarket_a_decentralized_peertopeer_marketplace/</strong></p>
<p>Last week, the Airbitz team hit the road and attended two different but equally valuable conferences, <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/insidebitcoins/2014/04/" target="_blank">Inside Bitcoins</a> NYC and <a href="http://bitcoinexpo.ca/" target="_blank">Bitcoin Expo</a> Toronto. This was a great opportunity to meet hundreds of bitcoin enthusiasts, industry experts and evangelists. However, a welcome first face-to-face meeting with some friends that we’ve been working with over the past several months turned out to be a highlight of the week.</p>
<p>We finally met up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COisLGwnb-M" target="_blank">Amir Taaki</a> (listed by Forbes as one of the top 30 entrepreneurs under 30 in 2014) and Pablo Martin of <a href="https://github.com/evoskuil/libbitcoin" target="_blank">libbitcoin</a> and <a href="https://darkwallet.unsystem.net/" target="_blank">Dark Wallet</a> fame, who had just signed up for the <a href="http://bitcoinexpo.ca/hackathon/" target="_blank">In-Crypto-We-Trust Hackathon</a>. Amir shared his concept, and knowing what a large task this was going to be to complete in 24 hours, Airbitz developers Damian Cutillo and William Swanson teamed up with them to code, fix bugs, and create a slick design and presentation.</p>

<p>The team collectively decided that the hackathon winnings should be fully donated to continuing the development of Amir’s project, <a href="https://github.com/evoskuil/libbitcoin" target="_blank">libbitcoin</a>, which Airbitz has been contributing to and is using to develop the Airbitz Wallet. Eric Voskuil wrote this about the implications of <a href="http://attacksurface.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/dark-market-trade-is-not-a-crime/" target="_blank">DarkMarket</a>, Eric is also a member of the libbitcoin team which also shares in this victory for freedom and equality on the net.</p>
