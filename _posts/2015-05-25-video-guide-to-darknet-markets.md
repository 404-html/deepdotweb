<p>I&#8217;ve created this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBS788BinNY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBS788BinNY</a></p>
<p>This video is a guide to setting up access to DarkNet Markets using Tails and steps through the process of making a purchase including acquiring BitCoins through <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=4v6y" target="_blank">LocalBitCoins.com</a> and laundering through BitCoin Fog.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any feedback and suggestions for improvements or topics to cover. Hopefully this is useful!</p></blockquote>
