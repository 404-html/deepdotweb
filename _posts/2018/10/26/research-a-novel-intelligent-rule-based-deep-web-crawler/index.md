<p>Developing a crawler for the deep web is definitely a tough task. The crawler&#8217;s processing time is by far the bottleneck for a deep web crawler. Whenever web FORMS have to be filled to access webpages that belong to the deep web, all possible values are used to fill these forms, so the combination of values is enormous. Accordingly, most crawlers are ineffective in fetching webpages from the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/06/08/the-dark-web-deep-web-and-dark-net-terminology-hell/">deep web</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-2559-5_1">A recently published paper</a> proposed the specifications of a novel deep web crawler. The new crawler includes an indexer that has the capability to fetch a huge number of webpages from the deep web, as well as, the surface web. Before delving more into the details of the new crawler, let&#8217;s take a look at some important definitions:</p>

<p><strong>What is a web crawler?</strong></p>
<p>In the early days of the internet, the number of webpages was low, and thus, crawling and indexing was a relatively simple process. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/08/21/novel-hybrid-web-crawler-searching-surface-deep-web/">A web crawler</a> is a tool utilized by search engines for indexing and fetching static webpages. However, the world wide web has enormously grown to include trillions of webpages. Moreover, the HTML content of the webpages is constantly altered by their authors. This renders the task of indexing and retrieval rather hard to achieve high levels of precision of retrieval. Results of retrieval are also affected by the user&#8217;s query, and thus, search engines process the query of the user to retrieve relevant results. The search engine crawlers, or spiders, periodically crawl the webpages and store them in the repositories to continuously update the content. A website&#8217;s content can only be enlisted as a part of a search engine&#8217;s results for users&#8217; search queries only if the content has been indexed by the search engine&#8217;s web crawler.</p>
<p><strong>What is a deep web crawler?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/02/01/new-concept-deep-web-crawlers/">A deep web crawler</a>, or a hidden web crawler, is a web crawler that indexes pages belonging to the deep web. This includes pages that require various forms of input to be retrieved, e.g. filling FORMS, or authentication via passphrases. Deep web crawlers have been developed via implementing a concept that depends on automatic result navigation, classification, and authentication.</p>
<p><strong>Specifications of the new intelligent-rule based deep web crawler:</strong></p>
<p>The proposed new deep web crawler includes an innovative indexer that can fetch a large number of webpages, not only from the deep web, but also from the surface web. The webpages indexed and retrieved from the deep web are fetched-based rules, as core and allied fields of the FORMS play an essential role. Based on the nature and domain of FORMs in HTML pages, functional dependency among the core and allied fields is identified. The SVM classifier is utilized to categorize the rule as mutually exclusive, least preferable, and most preferable. The webpages are fetched via using the most preferable fields in the FORMs. The fetched webpage is indexed, and the exact same architecture is then scaled to support distributed functionality with the aid of web services. The specification of the architecture processes a large number of webpages with an encouraging success rate and a low retrieval time.</p>
<p><strong>Performance of the new deep web crawler</strong>:</p>
<p>To examine the performance of the crawler, it was tested on the website 99acres.com. The site has a huge number of FORMs, where each element corresponds to a finite group of values. For these experiments, the precision of retrieval of webpages was used as a performance metric via which the number of relevant webpages fetched is calculated. The retrieval precision for both core and allied fields was presented. A hundred search queries were selected and submitted in the new crawler, as well as, to Google.</p>
<p>The retrieval performance of the new crawler has been compared with the retrieval performance of Google, and it has been proven that the new crawler achieves similar efficiency in procession of retrieval.</p>
<p>Coverage is another metric that has been used to measure the new crawler&#8217;s performance. Coverage refers to the ratio between the number of crawled webpages and the total number of webpages present in the database of the website. The coverage rate of the new crawler was 90% of that of other search engine systems.</p>
