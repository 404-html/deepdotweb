<p>A suspected Xanax vendor was arraigned on drug trafficking and money laundering charges in a hearing at the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois. According to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdil/pr/trial-scheduled-champaign-man-charged-allegedly-trafficking-counterfeit-xanax-money">a Department of Justice press release</a>, the suspected darkweb vendor’s first court appearance had taken an unusual turn when, instead of arraigning the man, the judge delayed the next hearing and ordered a full mental competency evaluation. The arraignment hearing was delayed pending the results of the evaluation. As evidenced by the hearing itself, the evaluation proved that the defendant was able to face the list of charges in a superseding indictment returned a few days before the hearing.<img class="wp-image-26984 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2018/10/word-image-11.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2018/10/word-image-11.jpeg 660w, /imgs/2018/10/word-image-11-300x150.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>According to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Central District of Illinois, Stephan Caamano, age 23, sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/xanax/">counterfeit Xanax bars</a> to darkweb buyers throughout the United States. A federal grand jury returned an indictment shortly after Caamano’s arrest that accused the former University of California at Berkeley student of two counts of distributing a controlled substance; one count of trafficking a counterfeit drug; and four counts of money laundering. All of the charges stemmed from his alleged darkweb drug operation or the financial proceeds of the alleged drug trafficking. A federal grand jury returned the charges in an indictment in June, days after Caamano’s arrest on May 29, 2018.</p>
<p>An affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint detailed the investigation that led to Caamano&#8217;s arrest and indictment. In December 2017, Customs and Border Protection agents alerted the Drug Enforcement Administration that they had been intercepting packages headed for Caamano&#8217;s address in Champaign, Illinois. They also seized a number of packages that had been sent to Caamano&#8217;s address from when he had lived in California. The packages, the according to the report from Customs and Border Protection agents, contained pill presses, pieces of equipment used in the manufacturing of pills, and alprazolam powder.</p>
<p>In an effort to follow up on the lead provided by Customs and Border Protection agents, agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration began watching Caamano, Caamano&#8217;s home, and an apartment Caamano rented for a short period of time. During the investigation, the DEA watched Caamano take hundreds of packages to United States Postal Service boxes in Champaign every week. With the help of the United States Postal Inspection Service, the DEA managed to pick up 33 envelopes from a single Post Office Box in Champaign. All 33 packages contained <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/xanax/">Xanax pills</a>, the DEA thought. The DEA opened one package headed to an address in St. Louis that contained nearly 400 grams of pills inside vacuum sealed bags labeled “Xanax.”</p>
<p>The DEA working the case interviewed the intended recipient of the package regarding the source of the pills. According to statements the St. Louis resident made to federal investigators, the pills had been ordered from a vendor on a darkweb marketplace who specialized in Xanax sales. One day later, a woman from Champaign notified the Champaign County Sheriff&#8217;s Office of four suspicious boxes that had arrived at her house. She told the police that the packages had not been shipped with the correct amount of postage so the Post Office returned the package to the listed return address. The boxes had her address listed as the sender’s address.</p>
<p>Champaign County Sheriff&#8217;s Office notified the DEA upon discovering that one of the boxes contained roughly <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/xanax/">21,000 Xanax pills</a>. The DEA seized the boxes and discovered that some of the pills looked different than the others and determined that the pills were counterfeits pressed to resemble genuine Pfizer Xanax pills. The boxes, in total, contained 83,538 counterfeit Xanax pills. The DEA arrested Caamano on May 29, 2018 after executing a search warrant at the man&#8217;s house and apartment. They found drugs, pill presses, cash, and digital evidence that allegedly connected Caamano to <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darkweb">a darkweb vendor account</a>.</p>
<p>At the hearing at United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, U.S. Magistrate Judge Eric I. Long scheduled a jury trial for November 19, 2019. Caamano, assuming the mental competency evaluation reflected his actual mental state, will likely retain an attorney and arrange a deal with the prosecution. The statutory maximum sentence for the most serious charges is 20 years in prison.</p>
