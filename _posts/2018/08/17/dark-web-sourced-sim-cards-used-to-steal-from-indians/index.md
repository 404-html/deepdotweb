<p>Dark web-related crimes have been on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/04/09/indian-sc-judge-states-the-need-to-regulate-the-cyber-sector-in-wake-of-dark-web-growth/">the rise in India</a>. The anonymity that comes with dark web use has proven to be a powerful tool to Indian criminals. Most Indians especially students have turned to the dark web, where they purchase drugs for resale to other Indian drug abusers. This also has been a huge challenge for Indian law enforcement. The latest development has seen Indian fraudsters turn to the dark web to acquire mobile SIM cards, which they in turn use to steal from unsuspecting targets, through what is known as SIM-swapping.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-26549" src="/imgs/2018/08/word-image-24.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2018/08/word-image-24.jpeg 375w, /imgs/2018/08/word-image-24-300x160.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p>This is how it works: Fraudsters identify the most vulnerable targets based on their social media profiles. After identifying the targets, the suspects find all the necessary details about their potential target. They mainly initiate cyber-attacks on the target, such as phishing tactics. The target details are mainly phone numbers and banking login details.</p>
<p>After acquiring all the prerequisite details about the targets, the fraudsters turn to <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/dark/">the dark web</a> where they purchase SIM cards anonymously. To fully gain control of the targets bank account the fraudsters initiate a SIM-swap. Swapping SIMs deactivates the targets SIM and activates that of the fraudster.</p>
<p>In most reported cases the criminals called their targets and claimed to be working with their mobile service providers. After calling, the fraudsters asked the targets to provide them with their Unique Identification Number (UID), which is issued to every Indian. This is the Aadhaar number with twelve unique digits. The Indian government recently made it mandatory for every Indian to link their SIM cards with the Aadhaar Number.</p>
<p>One can assume how easy it is thus to acquire an Aadhaar number by getting a SIM card. In doing so, the victims provide unlimited usage to their bank accounts and life details &#8212; this includes all validation codes and even One Time Pins (OTP) sent by banks to mobile devices. The criminals are able to withdraw money immediately, but do so in small increments so not to cause alarm to the banks.</p>
<p><a id="post-26540-_gjdgxs"></a> In one of the reported cases, Nidhi Sharma, a victim of this fraud and a Gurgaon resident, accepted the free help and sent her Unique Identification Number to the fraudster. After sending the number, the fraudster sent her a 20-digit number and asked her to forward it to the customer care number of her mobile service provider, which she did without hesitation.</p>
<p>Sharmaâ€™s SIM card was immediately deactivated, but she was unaware. In less than 48 hours, Sharma checked her email and to her surprise found notifications of logins made to her account and several withdrawals of cash money. The fraudster stole Rs 100,000 ($1,457), and withdrew the money in three portions, one of Rs 50,000, and two of Rs 25,000. Sharma managed to call her bank and stop any further withdrawals but had lost a significant amount of money already.</p>
<p>Cybercrime is such a huge menace to Indian authorities that they <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/07/01/india-government-to-hire-nerds-as-policemen-in-fight-against-cybercriminals/">hired nerds as cybercops</a>. The nerds are expected to help uncover the faces behind dark web fraudsters, drug traffickers, human traffickers and pedophiles. The nerds who will work as undercover agents in the dark web markets and forums are to use their knowledge and skills to succeed where Indian authorities, has failed terribly.</p>
