<p>A 33-year-old man from Spain—the seventh suspected child abuser in the Freiburg abuse case—admitted his role in the child abuse linked to the darknet chatroom “<a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/05/14/tabooless-chat-admin-sentenced-to-prison-and-therapy/">Tabooless Chat</a>” and the darknet child abuse forum “Elysium.” The man will be the last defendant on trial in this case until the mother of the victim and her partner receive final prison sentences and exhaust their appeals.<img class="wp-image-26556 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2018/08/word-image-26.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2018/08/word-image-26.jpeg 660w, /imgs/2018/08/word-image-26-300x150.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>The 33-year-old admitted that he had communicated with the nine-year-old boy&#8217;s mother and her partner on darknet child abuse sites in an attempt to rape the boy. The attempts paid off as the boy&#8217;s mother and partner willingly accepted money from pedophiles in exchange for several days of access to the boy. As far as the court knows, a total of eight individuals met and raped the boy. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/07/25/welfare-office-allegedly-ignored-all-warning-signs-in-freiburg-abuse-case/">This information came to light</a> only after the partner of the boy&#8217;s mother, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/02/06/child-abuse-arrest-unveiled-lost-playpen-member/">Christian T.</a>, helped the police identify other pedophiles who had also paid to abuse the boy.</p>
<p>Prosecutors initially <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/06/24/two-on-trial-for-selling-son-to-pedophiles-on-the-darknet/">charged the mother of the boy</a> and the mother&#8217;s partner. They had both participated in the abuse, witnessed the abuse, created videos and pictures of the abuse, and facilitated the abuse through the darknet. Law enforcement had video evidence seized from Elysium servers and from Christian T. that implicated numerous pedophiles with identities unknown to the court. But the identities only remained a secret for a few short months before Christian T. helped the police catch the same child abusers he had once accepted money from in exchange for the nine-year-old boy.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old man from Spain was one of the last rapists identified by Christian T. According to the man&#8217;s own confession, he had taken frequent trips from Spain to Baden-Württemberg between September 2016 and August 2017 for the sole purpose of abusing the boy. He had paid <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/06/24/two-on-trial-for-selling-son-to-pedophiles-on-the-darknet/">Christian T. and the boy&#8217;s mother</a> more than $10,000 and raped the boy at least 15 times, he told the court. The 33-year-old had both traveled greater distances and paid more money than any of the other defendants who participated in the boy&#8217;s abuse.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Nikola Novak is seeking a lengthy prison sentence. Other defendants, so far, have received sentences ranging from eight years in prison to 13 years in prison. But the 33-year-old had already served time in Spain for possession of child pornography. Novak will sell a sentence that reflects the 33-year-old’s status as a repeat offender. The defendant accepted responsibility for his crimes before the trial even started. “I&#8217;m responsible and guilty,” he told the court. He explained that he had raped the boy because of his uncontrollable attraction to children. He hopes he will be able to receive therapy in exchange for a lighter sentence.</p>
