<p>In Jacksonville, Florida, United States District Judge Brian J. Davis <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/jacksonville-man-sentenced-six-years-federal-prison-downloading-child-sexual-abuse">sentenced</a> yet another member of the darknet child pornography website PlayPen. The defendant, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/10/03/playpen-member-guilty-receiving-child-pornography/">42-year-old Jason Dean Barnes</a>, will spend six years in federal prison for downloading thousands of images depicting child abuse. After his release from prison, Barnes will spend 10 years on federal supervision. He will also register as a sex offender.</p>
<p>The FBI caught Barnes during the investigation into PlayPen in 2015. The investigation, known as Operation Pacifier, resulted in as many as 900 arrests worldwide. Very few of those arrests—at least in the United States—have ended in conviction or even in charges. Three major problems existed in the FBI’s case against members of the child pornography forum. The first problem emerged when the public discovered the FBI had identified thousands of Tor users through a piece of “malware.” They attacked users far outside of the jurisdiction of the judge who signed the warrant, permitting them to use the NIT.</p>
<p>That includes international users and Tor users who never even accessed the child pornography forum, according to some reports. During the discovery process, even after being ordered to release information on their NIT, the FBI refused to disclose anything that explained how they had managed to identify Tor users. This resulted in judges having no other choice than to throw out the evidence gathered as a result of the FBI’s hack.</p>
<p>The second problem was mostly jurisdictional and had less of an impact on court cases than the FBI’s refusal to reveal necessary information. The warrant obtained by the FBI permitted them to hack or investigate PlayPen users within the jurisdiction of the judge who signed the warrant. That judge did not have the authority to allow the hacking of computers anywhere else, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/04/22/judge-rules-warrant-used-playpen-investigation-not-valid/">including where Barnes lived</a>.</p>
<p>And the third issue caused controversy but likely had even less of an impact on the judge’s decision in any given court case involving a PlayPen member or moderator. But for a brief window during the final stage of Operation Pacifier, the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/18/fbi-going-department-justice-policy-keeping-playpen-running/">FBI became the largest distributor of child pornography</a> on the darknet. They assumed the role of the forum’s owner and used their position to identify members of the forum. In doing so, they allowed others to share illegal photos and material. It was during this window that the FBI identified Barnes.</p>
<p>In late February and early March 2015, the FBI identified a connection from an IP address in Florida. They later learned the IP belonged to the defendant. In July, the FBI announced the arrest of Barnes and the single charge he faced. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/jacksonville/news/press-releases/jacksonville-man-arrested-and-charged-with-receiving-child-pornography-over-the-internet">According to the FBI</a>, Barnes admitted that he had accessed the forum on those dates, as well as downloaded illegal photos and videos from the PlayPen severs. Investigators found 5,000 illegal photos and 500 illegal videos on electronic storage devices in Barnes’ home. In November 2017, the court found Barnes guilty of receiving child pornography.</p>
