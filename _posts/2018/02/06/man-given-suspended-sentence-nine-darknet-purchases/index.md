<p>A 24-year-old darknet drug trafficker managed to leave a Memmingen courtroom with only a suspended sentence. Some drug traffickers may barely leave the courtroom after buying less than five grams of a drug for personal use. But some people, like the 24-year-old IT specialist, dodged prison time after ordering kilograms of drugs.</p>
<p>In fairness, the man had procured a deal that would have been foolish to pass up. The prosecution and defense agreed that if the defendant admitted to committing the drug trafficking in some capacity, the prosecution would push only for a suspended sentence. This was likely a necessary move as the court had next to no evidence to support accusations involving the 24-year-old drug dealer.</p>
<p>According to the prosecution, the police only investigated the man after two of his so-called “friends” handed him over to the police. The police came, raided the man&#8217;s house, and then seized his computers. The house—aside from a scrap of paper with order information on it—contained no proof that the man had sold drugs at some point. The note, police reportedly discovered at a later date, contained the information needed to access the site that the 24-year-old had used when making his drug purchases.</p>

<p>With access to the site in question, investigators found that the 24-year-old had purchased two kilograms of amphetamine in one order. And then a second order of two kilograms of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/amphetamine/">amphetamine</a>. He had less of a need for cannabis though; investigators reportedly found records that the defendant had only purchased 250 grams of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/weed/">cannabis</a>. And an even smaller need for ecstasy; records indicated that he had only purchased 20 ecstacy pills. Unfortunately for the prosecution, no physical evidence of drug trafficking existed; the police found no scales or plastic bags during the execution of the search warrant. Just a note with the login information for a <a href="http://deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet">darknet drug market</a>.</p>
<p>During his three-month incarceration while waiting for a court appearance, the defendant came to terms with the prosecution. Through his lawyer, the man confessed to making nine darknet drug purchases between 2014 and 2016. He said that some of the packages never arrived. During his recent sentencing hearing, the court showed interest in the motivation behind the young man&#8217;s small operation. They said that the man did not fit the stereotype for the usual drug trafficker. Despite having dropped out of high school, the man had a found employment at an IT company. He lived at home with both parents and did not need the extra money. As surprising (or unsurprising) as it may seem, the defendant&#8217;s usual position likely inspired the basic sentence.</p>
<p>The defendant’s lawyer told the court that the 24-year-old sold drugs to please his friends. He wanted to see that he knew how to order drugs online and that he had contacts from his youth that also supplied drugs. The lawyer called it “helpfulness.” A drug test confirmed that the man did not use illegal drugs, the lawyer reminded the court, adding that his client did not want &#8220;any illegal crap.” The three months in pre-trial detention deeply impacted the young man, the court heard.</p>
<p>In light of the already required suspended sentence and the defense provided by the man&#8217;s attorney, the judge handed down a suspended sentence of one year and nine months. Furthermore, the 24-year-old was fined 1,000 euros—the court&#8217;s estimated value of the drugs the defendant had distributed.</p>
