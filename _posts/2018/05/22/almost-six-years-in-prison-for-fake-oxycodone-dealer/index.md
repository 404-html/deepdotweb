<p>At a federal district court in South Dakota, U.S. District Judge Karen E. Schreier sentenced Jacob Hubbs, 21, to almost six years in prison for ordering counterfeit oxycodone pills on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet/">the darknet</a> to resell locally. Hubbs had pleaded guilty to a fentanyl distribution conspiracy in February, 2018.<img class="wp-image-25793 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/word-image-41.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/word-image-41.jpeg 660w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/word-image-41-300x150.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>In 2017, the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation initiated an investigation into Hubbs for suspected drug trafficking or distribution. Several drug task forces from numerous state counties contributed to the investigation. The highway patrol assisted local police in the actual arrest and throughout different parts of the investigation. The court ordered that the indictment—along with the majority of related documents relevant to the case—remain sealed until an undisclosed date.</p>
<p>The sealed documents prevent the collection of information about the beginning of the case and events that led to Hubbs’ arrest. The seemingly excessive number of sealed court documents may play into any ongoing investigation into conspirators; in the February plea agreement, Hubbs admitted he had “voluntarily and intentionally joined in the agreement or understanding to distribute fentanyl” with at least one other individual. No court or arrest records reveal arrests connected to Hubbs’ operation. The police could actually be conducting an investigation into any number of alleged dealers connected to Hubbs.</p>
<p>Local authorities arrested the man in April 2017 after authorities learned that Hubbs had received a package of “light blue pills.” The pills had resembled oxycodone pills. But like dozens of dealers recently arrested for drug distribution, the pills contained fentanyl instead of oxycodone. Authorities seized a total of 1,000 pills at the man&#8217;s house. The <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/06/energy-control-drug-testing-service-for-deepweb-users/">pills tested positive for fentanyl</a> after a drug test was conducted during the investigation.</p>
<p>The police also discovered $11,000 in cash stashed inside Hubbs’ car. A statement from an employee of the Mitchell Department of Public Safety revealed that the case <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/10/25/south-dakota-teen-facingprison-ordering-20000-fentanyl-pills-form-dark-web/">had almost set state records</a> for the most opioids seized in a drug case. Hubbs’ case later went federal. During the legal battle, Hubbs argued that the severity of his case was lesser than that of other fentanyl distribution cases. His pills contained a small amount of fentanyl and he argued that the sentence should reflect the actual weight of the fentanyl in each pill. At the time, the government had been examining new federal guidelines for fentanyl distribution sentences that took weight and other factors into account.</p>
<p>The court reminded him that the new guidelines also recommended stricter punishment for dealers guilty of distributing fentanyl branded as a different drug. In the end, Hubbs pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute fentanyl. His plea agreement added that others had worked with him but did not indicate whether or not Hubbs had identified the co-conspirator(s) for the police. Hubbs admitted to placing the orders on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet/">the darknet</a> for the fake oxycodone pills.</p>
<p>Judge Schreier sentenced him to 70 months in prison followed by three years of federal supervision. His sentence will be served at an institution near his family.</p>
