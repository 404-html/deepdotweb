<p>This week’s summary of various cryptocurrency news and developments:</p>
<h2>New developments:</h2>
<p><strong>Microsoft temporarily stopped accepting Bitcoin payments</strong></p>
<p>Software and hardware giant Microsoft halted Bitcoin payments this week, as first reported by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency/">Bleeping Computer</a>, citing the “unstable” state of the cryptocurrency. When pressed, the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/microsoft-no-longer-accepts-bitcoin-customer-support-confirms/">company’s customer support revealed</a> that Microsoft decided to stop accepting the cryptocurrency back in July 2017, due to “problems processing payments.” A few days later, however, the company reinstated Bitcoin payments, reportedly after working with its payment provider to ensure “lower Bitcoins amounts would be redeemable by customers.” Notably, the cryptocurrency community escalated cases with the company once it stopped accepting Bitcoin, so an increase in customer demand could’ve been a factor behind the move.</p>

<ul>
<li>“The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO&#8217;s you have to look at individually. The Bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about Bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people. I&#8217;m not interested that much in the subject at all.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>World affairs:</h2>
<p><strong>South Korea in turmoil over potential cryptocurrency crackdown</strong></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency ecosystem took a hit this week, after the South Korean Ministry of Justice revealed it planned on drafting a cryptocurrency trading ban bill. The crackdown would supposedly protect cryptocurrency investors who could suffer from the so-called bubble. Moreover, regulators are afraid cryptocurrencies could be used to launder money. As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-bitcoin/south-korea-plans-to-ban-cryptocurrency-trading-rattles-market-idUSKBN1F002B">Reuters points out,</a> it could take years for the parliament to approve such a bill, and the government wasn’t completely behind the move as soon after its announcement the Ministry of Strategy and Finance revealed it doesn’t support nor agree with the proposal. In uproar, over 70,000 South Koreans signed a petition opposing the potential ban, and opposition parties rallied against the move that <a href="https://www.ccn.com/koreas-opposition-party-rallies-proposed-cryptocurrency-trading-ban/">was deemed a “policy of seclusion</a>.” This forced the Ministry of Justice to soften its stance on the ban proposal and claim it was just one of the options on the table.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In an official announcement, South Korean government reaffirms there will be NO TRADING BAN for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cryptocurrency?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cryptocurrency</a> market in the short term and NOTHING IS FINALIZED. </p>

<p><strong>U.S. Government to auction off over 3,800 BTC</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ukraine considers regulating Bitcoin and issuing its own cryptocurrency</strong></p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/news/2965.html">statement released by Ukraine’s security council</a> yesterday, authorities have formed a working group to introduce “comprehensive regulations” to the cryptocurrency sector. During a meeting on cybersecurity and infrastructure, it was remarked that a lack of regulations around the technology is a threat to the country’s economy and security, and this idea led to the creation of the working group, comprised of major government watchdogs, the central bank, the national police, and others. The group’s work will consist of determining which agencies have jurisdiction over cryptocurrency markets, and creating a system to collect income tax on cryptocurrency trades. The statement also says that the country’s central bank may create its own cryptocurrency</p>
<p>The government’s statement reads:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Moreover, the authorities were assigned to develop a mechanism for ensuring access of law enforcement bodies to the data of cryptocurrency exchanges with the obligation of the given subjects to store information about all transactions within the period established by law for financial institutions and disclosure of customer information on a motivated request.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
