<p>The high amounts of drug overdose related deaths, and the popularity of the Darknet marketplace scene among the youth, has brought authorities to the doorstep of Aaron Shamo. He was accused of manufacturing many dangerous opioid drugs and shipping them over to people who ordered them through his shop on a darknet marketplace.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence used against him in the law court, Shamo has pleaded not guilty to all counts leveled against him. The authorities have set a trial for the young man to once again appear before the courtroom after spending almost 15 months in police custody.</p>
<p>According to a report, the authorities conducted an intense search of his home and discovered 7,000 pills of fentanyl made to look like oxycodone.</p>
<p>Authorities also came across 25,000 Xanax pills. Brian Besser, a DEA agent said this “is absolutely catastrophic, this adds to the opioid epidemic. These tablets are primarily consisting of counterfeit oxycodone, 30-milligram oxycodone tablets, and counterfeit Xanax.” The suspect and his accomplices made over $2 million dollars in less than a year, showing how much they were committed to their drug trafficking business. “Over the course of time, millions of counterfeit tablets were distributed across the continental United States,&#8221; said Besser.</p>
<p>Authorities also seized $500,000 worth of Bitcoin and guns. 500,000 pills were also seized from the search. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/12/06/28-overdose-death-linked-darknet-drug-ring-utah/">Twenty-eight overdose deaths in Utah</a> were linked to the drugs sold by Shamo. In other words, Shamo was responsible for killing people through his illegal imported drugs.</p>
<p>Shamo received the raw products from China and then mixed them with whatever substance he was looking for. <a href="http://kutv.com/news/local/trial-set-for-man-accused-of-running-international-drug-ring">His trial has been set</a> to cover four weeks starting August 20, 2018.</p>
<p>The US law has a zero tolerance to elicit drug possession and trafficking, and if found guilty, he may spend many years in jail. Shamo faces up to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of $1 million if convicted. Fentanyl overdose continues to rise in Utah and the whole USA despite the arrest of Shamo, signifying that he was just a part of massive drug trafficking in the country.</p>
<p>The attorneys of Shamo’s accomplice also revealed that they are negotiating deals with the prosecutor. His accomplices are Drew Wilson Crandall and Michael. &#8220;We are hopeful and anticipate that there is going to be a resolution,&#8221; defense attorney Jim Bradshaw said to the court.</p>
<p>The assistant US Attorney General, Michael Gadd, hinted that the investigation has not been finalized yet considering the gravity of evidence that turned out in the earlier search. He said that a recent search and investigation has produced 40 boxes of documents and a number of computer data drives.</p>
<p>He also said that 3 terabyte of evidence has been discovered and 70 witnesses are being lined up including 500 exhibits before the day of the trial. According to the court, Shamo and his accomplices manufactured many pills of fake prescription drugs and sold them to people using the Darknet.</p>
<p>The development of his arrest was made known to the general public when the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/01/25/u-s-prosecutors-cash-seized-bitcoins/">US prosecutor decided to cash in on the</a> seized $500,000 worth of Bitcoin which kept the pace with the high rise of the Bitcoin price in the last quarter of 2017 and valued around $8 million.</p>
<p>According to the attorney office in Utah, the decision to auction his seized Bitcoin was due to the Bitcoin volatility and they intend to keep the exchanged fund until the trial is over. Following the set of the trial, the destiny of the seized assets and that of Shamo will soon be decided.</p>
<p>Shamo’s arrest was celebrated by many and even his arrest called for different headlines. His arrest was said to be one of the biggest in history. Utah has been much affected by the influx of illicit drugs from their darknet marketplaces and the overdose death rate increases annually despite the laid down regulations to control it.</p>
<p>Even as authorities continue to make an arrest, it is being suggested that they consider a one-time measure that will solve the problem at the root.</p>
