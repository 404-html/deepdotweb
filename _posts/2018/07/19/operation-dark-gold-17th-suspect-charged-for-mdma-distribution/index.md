<p>According to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sd/pr/first-nationwide-undercover-operation-targeting-darknet-vendors-results-arrests-more-35">a press release</a> from United States Attorney Ron Parsons, a South Dakota man laundered thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin and bought numerous packages of MDMA from darknet vendors. The defendant, John Edward Monette, 49, was charged in connection with the recent federal investigation into darknet vendors known as Operation Dark Gold.<img class="wp-image-26337 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2018/07/word-image-42.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2018/07/word-image-42.jpeg 660w, /imgs/2018/07/word-image-42-300x150.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Homeland Security Investigations, court documents revealed, caught Monette the same way they caught many of the other suspected drug dealers and money launderers during Operation Dark Gold. The original Dark Gold press release revealed that the Department of Justice had arrested 35 <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/bust/">suspected darknet vendors</a> and associates. They revealed 16 suspects in the announcement. This announcement, published by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the District of South Dakota, listed Monette as the seventeenth Dark Gold suspect.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice sealed Monette&#8217;s full indictment. In its place, they released a redacted version that charged Monette with knowingly and intentionally distributing a mixture and a substance containing MDMA. The charge: conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. MDMA is listed as a Schedule I substance by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p>According to the redacted indictment, investigators had not determined the date Monette launched his MDMA operation. They knew, though, that he continued until April 25, 2018. Furthermore, as reflected by the conspiracy charge, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/hsi/">Homeland Security Investigations</a> accused Monette of working with other individuals “known and unknown to the Grand Jury.” If the investigators know the identities of these suspected conspirators, they will likely become the 18th and 19th Operation Dark Gold suspects.</p>
<p>In October 2016, Homeland Security Investigations arrested a money launderer who had been working with darknet vendors and their bitcoin. The money launderer advertised his services on darknet markets. According to information released by <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/hsi/">Homeland Security Investigations</a>, the arrested money launderer allowed investigators to use their accounts and identity on the darknet in an attempt to catch unsuspecting darknet venders. The money launderer’s original business model required the vendor to send bitcoin to the money launderer’s bitcoin wallet. The money launderer, after taking their cut, mailed the darknet vendor cash through the United States Postal Service.</p>
<p>The service was not used only by darknet vendors. Other suspects with illicitly earned Bitcoin used the money laundering service as well, court documents explained. No court documents indicated that Monette had been selling drugs on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet/">the darknet</a>. Sealed documents, though, may reveal otherwise.</p>
<p>Between May 31, 2017 and October 24, 2017, the Homeland Security Investigations agents—posing as the darknet money launderer—conducted 11 transactions with Monette. The transactions totaled $19,000. And, after learning Monette&#8217;s address, the investigators intercepted numerous MDMA packages.</p>
<p>A grand jury returned a federal indictment on May 8 and federal authorities arrested Monette shortly thereafter. He faces the single MDMA distribution charge.</p>
