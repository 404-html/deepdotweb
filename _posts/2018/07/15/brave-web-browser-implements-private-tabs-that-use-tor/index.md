<p>The latest release of the Brave web browser includes a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/brave-advances-browser-privacy-with-tor-powered-tabs/">new privacy feature</a> that is in beta testing. When a private tab is opened in <a href="https://brave.com/tor-tabs-beta/">version 0.23</a> of the Brave web browser, users now have the option to enable the new privacy feature that uses Tor onion routing to help increase privacy. This new feature makes private tabs actually private, unlike traditional private tabs found in other web browsers. Enabling Tor in a private tab allows a user to hide their web browsing traffic from their Internet Service Provider (ISP) as well as government view. Using Tor is also helpful in LOCALNETWORK. After the new Tor feature is enabled in a private tab, the web browser will automatically use the DuckDuckGo privacy search engine by default.</p>
<p>The Brave web browser is different from most other browsers in that it comes with built-in features such as ad blocking, tracker blocking, and HTTPS upgrading (a feature which functions similarly to the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) HTTPS Everywhere add-on for web browsers like Firefox and Chrome). Brave Software, the company which develops the Brave web browser, was <a href="https://brave.com/about/">founded by</a> Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and Brian Bondy, the co-founder of Mozilla. The company is planning to integrate a cryptocurrency they have created, which is known as the Basic Attention Token, or BAT, with the Brave web browser. In future versions of the Brave web browser, users will be able to anonymously tip websites using micro donations of BAT.</p>
<p>The developers of the Brave web browsers having been working on integrating Tor into private tabs for over a year. They believe that consumers have become more conscious of their digital privacy rights and are beginning to use more software which will protect their privacy. “This is not a blip. You&#8217;re seeing a rising consciousness about privacy. We&#8217;re playing a long game here. We&#8217;re putting energy on the side of privacy, and part of that involves energy on the hard case. Tor is the hard case,” Brendan Eich, the Chief Executive Officer of Brave, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy-browser-brave-tor-trump/">told </a><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy-browser-brave-tor-trump/"><em>CNET</em></a>.</p>
<p>Brave Software is not the only organization implementing Tor into their web browser. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/24/tor-mozilla-working-together-protection-malware/">In 2016</a> the Mozilla Project began collaborating with the Tor Project. The collaboration between the Mozilla Project and Tor Project began with a project called <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/10/mozilla-implementing-tor-privacy-features-firefox-builds/">Tor Uplift</a>. That project has resulted in the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/12/03/mozilla-quietly-adds-features-tor-browser-firefox/">integration of patches</a> for Firefox that were written by the Tor Project, including First Party Isolation, also known as Cross Origin Identifier Linkability, as well as Fingerprinting Resistance, also known as Cross Origin Fingerprinting Unlinkability.</p>
<p>Now the Mozilla Project is aiming to integrate even more privacy protections from the Tor Project through a joint project known as <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Fusion">FUSION</a>, or the <strong>F</strong>irefox <strong>USI</strong>ng <strong>ON</strong>ions project. With this new collaborative effort between Mozilla and Tor even more features from Tor Browser will be implemented into the Firefox web browser, some which will work by default, and other features, such as being able to browse using Tor’s onion routing, will be an option users can choose to enable for private tabs. The ultimate goal of the collaboration between the Mozilla Project and the Tor Project is to enable Tor to use the main Firefox trunk, instead of a fork of Firefox, and by eventually integrating all Tor Browser patches into Firefox.</p>
<p>For users who require the highest level of privacy protection for their web browsing, it is still recommended to use the Tor Project’s Browser. There are still multiple security issues and other problems that need to be addressed before the Brave browser’s Tor integration is out of beta testing. The Github repository for the Brave web browser code lists <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Abrave+label%3Ator%2Fleakproofing&amp;type=Issues">seven different issues</a> relating to the integration of Tor into Brave’s private tabs. One such <a href="https://github.com/brave/muon/issues/519">issue</a> is that the code for the Brave web browser must be audited for Domain Name System (DNS) leaks. Another <a href="https://github.com/brave/muon/issues/521">issue</a> among the seven is that all protocols must be audited for leaks in Tor mode to block them or redirect them through the Tor network.</p>
