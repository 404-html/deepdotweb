    <p>Two brothers who ran a pills manufacturing business were busted and charged after a package they had ordered from a dark web vendor based in China was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/03/05/dealers-busted-customs-intercepted-amphetamine-package/">intercepted by customs authorities</a>. The two brothers allegedly shared duties so that one of them specialized in the chemistry of drug making while the other took care of the drug distribution operation.</p>

    <p>28-year-old Evans C. Stansbery and his elder brother 30-year-old Matthew Stansbery were presented before Judge William C. Houser of the Kitsap County Superior Court where the prosecution charged them with over five counts including one of involvement in organized crime. The prosecution made arguments using information it received from witnesses who worked with the two brothers in the pills production and distribution operation.</p>
    <p>The police began investigations against the Stansbery brothers after a deputy of the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Department received a tip-off informing him that Evans was expecting a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/09/13/pennsylvania-man-charged-with-distributing-12000-xanax-pills-and-other-drugs-from-the-darknet/">Xanax package</a> from China. The tip-off received in July prompted the police to keep tabs on the two brothers after notifying the customs authorities of an incoming package that contained drugs.</p>
    <p>On being informed of the package, the customs authorities placed extra care in their screening process resulting in the interception of a parcel addressed to a Barnett street residence. The parcel had Xanax hidden in printer cartridges. According to police documents the cartridges carried a total of 54.3 grams of Xanax. The interception of the package gave the police a probable cause that enabled them to quickly get a search warrant against the apartment to which the package was headed.</p>
    <p>On acquiring the search warrant, the police raided the Barnett Street apartment where they found the brother’s fully equipped and operational pills production laboratory. The search also led to the discovery of three pill press machines, Oxycodone, Methadone and Xanax dye stamps, chemicals used in binding and cutting, and digital weighing machines.</p>
    <p>The search also led to the seizure of already made pills and other drugs including cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. The police also claim that they found preparation procedures for some of the pills the brothers made. The police discovered approximately $7,591 in cash. While going on with the search, Evan agreed to answer some of the police questions.</p>
    <p>According to the police, Evan disclosed that the pill presses were capable of producing 80 pills per minute. Evans also told the police that Matthew ordered the drugs and drug-making equipment from the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/dark/">dark web</a> and had them shipped to a number of addresses such as where they resided and to one of Evan’s ex-girlfriend’s house. He then told the police that after the equipment and chemicals were delivered, they would go ahead and produce the pills and distribute them for sale. The search was followed by the arrest of the two brothers and other people that helped them in their operations.</p>
    <p>The prosecution led by Attorney C. Takos had a witness who supported Evan’s words and said that Evan was in charge of the money while Matthew took responsibility for all the chemical processes involved in the drug manufacturing operation. The prosecution also had another witness who played a part in the pills production operation and who describe Matthew as a Chemistry pro.</p>
    <p>According to the statement of the prosecution, Matthew admitted to the police that he provided the prerequisite chemical knowledge required in the pills production process. Another witness embroiled in the case disclosed that some of the drugs were shipped to a dealer who then sold them in Seattle, while another witness said Evan handled the entire pills distribution process and the proceeds obtained from sales.</p>
    <p>Evan and Matthew appeared before the judge with a defense attorney and both of them entered a not guilty plea despite having allegedly admitted being the masterminds behind the drug-making operation to the police. Considering the evidence presented before him, Judge Houser held the two brothers on a $100,000 bail and said that the complicated nature of their criminal operation drove him into setting the bail amount so high. Judge house scheduled their trial for the 10th of December.</p>
