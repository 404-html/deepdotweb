<blockquote><p>FBI agents raided a New Orleans home this week as part of an international crackdown on the so-called “Dark Web” — anonymous, underground marketplaces that facilitate the online sale of weapons, drugs and illegal services.</p>
<p>Particulars of the raid, which happened Thursday morning in Faubourg Marigny, weren’t made public, and it wasn’t clear who lived at the targeted address, 2559 N. Rampart St., at the corner of Franklin Avenue.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Romig Haskins, an FBI spokeswoman, declined to say what was seized or whether anyone was arrested. She would only confirm that the operation stemmed from a global effort to shut down websites that remain hidden through a popular software known as Tor, or the onion router.</p></blockquote>
