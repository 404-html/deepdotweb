    <p><strong>Info source  <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/silk-road-like-website-part-of-investigation-into-man-arrested-by-fbi-for-having-alleged-bomb-making-materials/Content?oid=2819736">sfexaminer.com</a>:</strong></p>
    <p>When the FBI searched the Russian Hill apartment of Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II on May 31, they were not looking for components of a bomb.</p>
    <p>They had hoped to find lethal toxins Chamberlain allegedly purchased on anonymous websites, part of the &#8220;darknet&#8221; or &#8220;deepweb,&#8221; using cybercurrency known as Bitcoin. They were also looking for the computers he used to access those sites.</p>
    <p>It does not appear that is what they found, since they charged Chamberlain, who was arrested June 2 after a three-day manhunt and remains in custody, with possessing bomb- making materials.</p>
    <p>According to the search warrant, the FBI had been led to his home after a series of tips and arrests because of his alleged use of anonymous sites to purchase abrin and pure nicotine, both lethal toxins.</p>
    <p>&#8220;The investigation has revealed that Chamberlain has utilized an anonymous, internet-based marketplace known as <strong>Black Market Reloaded</strong>,&#8221; states the unsealed affidavit.</p>
    <p>The document states that the FBI expected to find evidence of &#8220;hidden services websites such as Silk Road, Bitmail, or Bitcoin payment websites and or systems.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Such darknet sites have been the subject of federal investigations with links to San Francisco before.</p>
    <p>Most recently, Ross William Ulbricht was arrested by FBI agents in a Glen Park library in February and charged with running Silk Road, a site that offered drugs, money laundering, murder-for-hire and other illegal services.</p>
    <p>It&#8217;s unclear what, if any, connection the joint investigation, which involved the FBI, ATF and Homeland Security investigations units, had with previous probes into black market websites.</p>
    <p>But the two sites, Black Market Reloaded and Silk Road, do appear similar in terms of how they operate and what they offer.</p>
    <p>The investigation found that Black Market Reloaded &#8220;provides a sales platform that enables vendors and buyers &#8230; to conduct anonymous transactions online involving the sale and a variety of illegal goods.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Those goods included toxins, chemicals, firearms, biological agents, explosives and narcotics, according to the warrant.</p>
    <p>Chamberlain has yet to make a plea in the case. His next court date is scheduled for Monday.</p>
