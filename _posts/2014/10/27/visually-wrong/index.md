Probably trying to promote bonding between human and animals, it came out to look just a little wrong.</p>
    <p>Portraying emotions in animals can be challenging, but howling doesn&#8217;t seem to be the right expression for this picture. The part where the children&#8217;s hands holds their paw was probably the main reason why this is a bad drawing to put in a childcare centre.</p>
