    <p>For those of you not familiar with DoctorX, Probably the most important harm reduction initiative for the DarkNetMarket community in the past year  &#8211; Dr. Fernando Caudevilla, a Spanish Physician who has been offering professional advice about Drugs and Health during the last year in Silk Road1 and Silk Road2 forums:</p>

    <p>http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/<wbr/>index.php?topic=314.0</p>
    <p>As he told us yesterday &#8211; He have opened a thread to offer his services in The Hub forums. Although he have been doing this in SR1 and SR2 forums, he feels more comfortable in a forum not associated to any market and, probably will definitely move to the Hub in some months, although he will keep both SR2 and Hub by the moment:</p>

    <p>This is the introduction thread from the Hub Forums:</p>
    <p><strong>===Start Quote===</strong></p>
    <p>Hello,</p>
    <p>I am a Spanish Family Physician working in fields like risk reduction associated to drug use, club drugs, new synthetic drugs, cannabis therapeutic and steroids since 1999. I would like to contribute to this forum offering professional advice in topics related to drug use and health: pharmacological interactions, risks of drug use in particular conditions (specific diseases, problems of health…), contraindications, adverse effects and toxicity, risk reduction measures…</p>
    <p>This advice cannot replace a complete face-to-face medical evaluation, but I know how difficult can be to talk frankly about these things. You can see my CV on my personal web-page http://www.doctorcaudevilla.com</p>
    <p>You can also use PM for personal questions or video-conference in my web (available only in Spanish).</p>
    <p>I will try to answer all your questions (if I know the answers) but I have limited time</p>
    <p>DoctorX</p>
    <p>Please look over and follow these guidelines before posting:</p>
    <p>1) Have a look into this thread or in old threads where I have been offering this service. It is possible your question has been asked and answered already in SR1 or SR2 forums:</p>
    <p>http://web.archive.org/web/20131015051405/https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=147607.0<br/>
    http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=314.0</p>
    <p>2) Try to be as descriptive as possible, the more accurate your information (age, gender, health problems, prescription/illegal drug use&#8230;) the more specific my answer will be.</p>
    <p>3) Information in this thread is general advice, but it can&#8217;t replace a personal, medical evaluation. Health problems must be evaluated in person. No responsibility is assumed by misunderstanding of this information.</p>
    <p>4) Please only use PM and PGP for personal questions. Most of the questions can be answered in general forum and can be useful to other people</p>
    <p>5) Answering questions entails dedicating time and personal effort. Consider supporting this service with a donation</p>
