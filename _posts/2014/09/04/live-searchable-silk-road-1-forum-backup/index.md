<p>For those of you wanting to search trough the old Silk Road forum and can&#8217;t be bothered with going trough thousands of text files from the StExo backup on <a href="http://antilop.cc/sr/">antilop.cc/sr</a>, a searchable backup was introduced by Alfred &#8211; the <a href="/2014/01/15/cross-marketplace-discussion-news-the-hub-forum-is-live/">Hub forum</a> owner,  the backup can be accessed at this url: <strong>http://hubsrf3plqrbuf4i.onion/</strong></p>
<p>Although it cannot be browsed like a normal forum, its still great for finding any old thread by any user in a simple search.</p>
<div id="attachment_6949" style="width: 888px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/imgs/2014/09/DPR.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6949" src="/imgs/2014/09/DPR.png" alt="Threads By Dread Pirate Roberts" width="878" height="429" srcset="/imgs/2014/09/DPR.png 878w, /imgs/2014/09/DPR-300x147.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Threads By Dread Pirate Roberts</p></div>
<p>This was the original announcement from the Hub forum (Original thread: http://thehub7dnl5nmcz5.onion/index.php?topic=4966.0;topicseen):</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>I have something exciting to share with you today.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I created the Hub was to re-build the community we had back before the Silk Road bust on October 2nd, 2013.  (It is mental that it has been nearly a year since then is it not?)</p>
<p>To many people, the forums have always been more important than the marketplaces themselves. For me, and many others here, we first found our place in the community on the original Silk Road forums. But the forum was seized, taking with it a huge wealth of knowledge, information and fun discussion accumulated over the years.</p>
<p>As many of you know, a backup of these forums exists. But until now, it has only existed as a messy collection of zipped html files.</p>
<p>And so, I am proud to present to all of you interested in the complete Silk Road forum backup, hosted by the Hub, and with a search functionality added to help you find the old content you miss faster.</p>
<p>This is still nothing like the layout you will be used to, and it is by no means perfect.  I debated whether or not to release this URL or wait until I was able to &#8216;beautify&#8217; the site a bit more, but decided that since the functionality is there it may as well be used.  Look for some graphical enhancements to the front page, as well as other new features and updates to come.</p>
<p>I hope you all find it useful, a lot of hard work has gone into it.</p>
