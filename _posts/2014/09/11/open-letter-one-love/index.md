    <p><em>The personal column of PerfectScans: The Silk Roads No 1 Digital Forger and Fixer Of Things You Need :)</em></p>
    <p>To The One I Love,</p>
    <p>I know your parents, your grandparents, I know your birthday, I know your grades from school. I know what you studied. I know whether you drive, and what you drive, and how well you drive.</p>
    <p>I know who all your friends are and where you work. I know your favorite music and what you like and hate most. I have pictures of that night you drank to much and kissed that guy.</p>
    <p>I even know what you have been thinking about of late, I know what you want, I know what you need, where you like to go and the thing you want to buy. I know even if you like it hard or soft and if you prefer guys or girls and what color too.</p>
    <p>I know exactly how much you earn, where you bank it and where you spend it. I listen to your phone calls and read you every email.</p>
    <p>I watch you 24 hours a day, 7 a week and best of all, you never even see me.</p>
    <p>My main concern is that you do not know that I watch and that you do exactly as I tell you do when I tell you to do it.</p>
    <p>If you dare to cross me, in ANY of my rules. Here is how it will work.</p>
    <p>I will punish you. If just minor things, I will likely take some of your money. I know you work hard for it and I set the hours and wages so I know how hard I can hurt you and exactly how much to take.</p>
    <p>As long as you behave, and do not step over my lines then the punishments will remain small and you will recover from each. I like just my bitches to know where they stand.</p>
    <p>However, if you try to leave me, or break out of my world, or speak against me, or dare to incite others to do the same. If you try to run from me or stand against me then here how it will play.</p>
    <p>I can take your liberty whenever I choose. I can hold you, detain you, whenever I choose.</p>
    <p>I can make everyone think, whatever I want them to think about you.</p>
    <p>I can take your job, your home, and all that you own.</p>
    <p>In fact if you really want to know. I can remove you from existence anytime I choose and you will be forgotten in no time at all as I decide whether you exist or not.</p>
    <p>I can simply remove your name from the program whenever I choose.</p>
    <p>Just so you know where you stand. Your obedience to me is expected at all times.</p>
    <p>When I say jump, you ask how high !.</p>
    <p>You value to me is as follows.</p>
    <p>Gross input less between 20-40% to me. Plus extras I take on all that you spend.</p>
    <p>Estimated average value to me. Lifetime.150,000EU.</p>
    <p>In return, I will offer to educate you, sometimes for free however, you will learn what I want you to learn. If you are sick, I will provide you some treatment of a reasonable standard but not for any large length of time. If you are unable to truly work for me, then I shall give you a minimum income so you can feed yourself and I maybe will provide you a bed.</p>
    <p>If you are in danger from any “rogue” programs I have lost control of, I will offer some protection as long as the cost is not too high and we have available units in that area on that day and time.</p>
    <p>I will provide some options on entertainments you can enjoy, again as long as I agree these are “suitable” for you.</p>
    <p>I think its best I decide these things for you.</p>
    <p>And when you die I would make sure you do not owe me any money and be sure that your family cover the costs of burying your body.</p>
    <p>Personally I think this deal is fair and if you do not, you are welcome to complain. Thankfully your complaints will never find my ears as quite frankly, I just do not care.</p>
    <p>You need to understand; I am far more important to this world than you and my needs are far greater than yours.</p>
    <p>I will do as I please, when I please and whatever I please. I will take from you want I want, when I want and that is how it is.</p>
    <p>You belong to me, and always will and I will fuck you my way, whenever I want and no does NOT mean no in my world and this is my world and your are mine.</p>
    <p>Please allow me to introduce myself.</p>
    <p>I am:<br />
    Google<br />
    Facebook<br />
    Sony<br />
    Nokia<br />
    Enron<br />
    Mobil<br />
    Glaxo<br />
    To name but a few. And we also own and control the following, you may recognize a few.</p>
    <p>European Union ( Your Owners)<br />
    US Congress<br />
    FBI<br />
    NSA<br />
    DEA<br />
    FDA</p>
    <p>Now, my little bitch.</p>
    <p>Where shall we dine? You know I love you dearly and would never hurt you.</p>
    <p>Your Man.</p>
