    <p><strong>Following the story we have <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/25/dutch-man-vendor-supertrips-plead-guilty-selling-illegal-drugs-millions-shuttered-silk-road/">reported a couple of weeks ago</a> and As it was published today by the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-trafficker-pleads-guilty-in-chicago-to-distributing-drugs-over-underground-silk-road-website-20140508,0,5832398.story">Chicago Tribune</a></strong>:</p>
    <p>The largest drug trafficker on the now-shuttered underground Silk Road website pleaded guilty today in Chicago to distributing huge quantities of Ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal substances to customers around the world in exchange for millions of dollars worth of the digital currency bitcoins.</p>
    <p>Prosecutors made it clear that Cornelis Jan Slomp, who went by the screen name &#8220;SuperTrips,&#8221; is cooperating with law enforcement as the Dutch national entered his guilty plea to a count of drug distribution before U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly.  Prosecutors agreed to recommend a 15-year sentence in prison if he continues to cooperate. He could have faced as much as 40 years in prison.</p>
    <p>After court, Slomp’s attorney, Paul Petruzzi said his client’s cooperation could include testimony against Silk Road founder, Ross Ulbricht, also known as “Dread Pirate Roberts,”  who was indicted on drug conspiracy and murder-for-hire charges in New York. Ulbricht, who was arrested in October, was accused of trying to arrange the murder of a Silk Road distributer believed to be cooperating with law enforcement.</p>
    <p>Slomp is also providing information about numerous drug suppliers and distributors in his chain of command, including a cocaine supplier from Chicago and a man in Florida who was purportedly going to take over Slomp’s U.S. operations, court records show.</p>
    <p>Slomp, a one-time computer software programmer, was described in a plea agreement as being “the world’s largest drug-trafficking vendor on Silk Road.” He admitted to distributing worldwide more than half a million pills of Ecstasy, 104 kilograms of powdered Ecstasy, as well as large quantities of cocaine, LSD, marijuana and prescription painkillers, according to prosecutors.</p>
