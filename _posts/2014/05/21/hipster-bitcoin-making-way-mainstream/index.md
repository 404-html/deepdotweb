    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Bask in the ambiance while you can boys and girls, as you are currently enjoying Bitcoin “before it becomes cool” according to worldwide financial experts.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Bitcoin, in all of its volatile, semi-anonymous beauty is starting to become recognized beyond the world of the Dark Net – Also known as “society”. With the first Bitcoin ATM being launched in Vancouver, Canada in late October 2013, so far more than one hundred have sprung up world wide – and more are yet to come!</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">At a recent annual shareholders meeting, eBay CEO John Donahoe said they were considering Bitcoin integration for PayPal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We think Bitcoin will play a very important role in the future. Exactly how that plays, and how we can best take advantage of it and enable it with PayPal, thats something we&#8217;re actively considering. Its on our radar screen</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This is a big jump from a statement by PayPal CEO David Marcus who says he was “intrigued by Bitcoin” but did not think PayPal was</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">ready to allow its customers to link their accounts with Bitcoin wallets.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Considering the pair have made reference in the past about Bitcoin being a “potential competitive threat”, it seems they could be adapting the “If you cant beat them, Join them” approach.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But if bidding for knock off iPhone&#8217;s and express shipping jeans from China isn&#8217;t how you like to spend your weekend, then perhaps a trip to Las Vegas is? As they say, “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas” and what better way to really have no idea as to what you spent $5000 on in the hotel gift shop, than to use your Bitcoin!</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In late January 2014, The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel and Golden Gate Hotel &amp; Casino located in downtown Las Vegas, started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for its hotel suites, gift shop, and multiple food outlets – with the introduction of Bitcoin being accepted within the Casino itself soon to come.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">To thank for all this recent “Mainstream madness” is Georgia based Bitcoin Merchant Developer Bitpay – Which was in the news just last week after receiving a $30 Million Investment from Sir Richard Branson, who wishes to accept Bitcoin as payment for his more lucrative endevour, “Virgin Galactic”. Bitpay is also responsible for bringing Bitcoin to the likes of WordPress, Gyft, NameCheap, Shopify and TigerDirect – Just to name a few out of their 30,000 estimated clientèle.</p>
