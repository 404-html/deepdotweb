    <p>As some of you probably know,  we receive A LOT of emails with simple questions about every aspect of the Deepweb / DNM scene.  As part of our policy to help anyone what we usually do when we receive those emails is simple &#8211; either post a link to the place we know that has the answer on  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets" target="_blank">/r/dnm</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarketsNoobs/" target="_blank">/r/dnmnoobs</a> , Or looking for the answer somewhere on the other forums (such as the hub), marketplace forums or just any other clearnet source. In case we know the answer we will answer it our self.</p>
    <p>Since we think that this information is important and should be easier to find,  We decided to implement a Community based Q&amp;A system on the site where people will be able to ask questions and get answers from other people  similar to the known systems such as Quora or Stack Exchange. It is up for the past two weeks or so to make sure it works well and now we have decided to make an &#8220;official launch&#8221;.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2014/05/qna1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5618" src="/imgs/2014/05/qna1.png" alt="qna" width="589" height="393" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/qna1.png 1144w, /imgs/2014/05/qna1-300x200.png 300w, /imgs/2014/05/qna1-1024x683.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></a></p>
    <p>The System is not for discussions &#8211; for this, there is Reddit and the various forums, but  just for Questions and Answers with the intent of keeping the info available, letting everyone participate with helping each other &#8211; while keeping a high standard of the provided information using strict moderation to avoid spamming and false information and the ability to rate useful information with the intent of creating a large database of up to date and useful info.</p>
    <p>The system is super easy to use  &#8211; <strong>No Login / Registration is required to post Q&amp;A&#8217;s</strong> &#8211; Only if you wish to Upvote / Downvote / Get rated and accept answers you will need to register. You can use fake mail if you wish, it wont be verified.</p>
    <p>The only thing that need to be done to Ask / Answer Questions is to navigate to this part of the site &#8211;  <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/questions-answers-beta/" target="_blank"><strong>Here</strong></a> And click &#8220;Ask a Question&#8221;.</p>
    <p>In Order to answer a question you need to click a specific question and submit an answer.</p>
    <p><strong>The System is still in Beta and being set up &#8211; so please <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">report to us</a> any bugs you find &#8211; We will test it over some time to decide how to further develop this.</strong></p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/questions-answers-beta" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Click Here To <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ask Your Question!</span></span></a></strong></h2>
    <p>Special thanks to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/u/galaxyandspace">/u/galaxyandspace</a> (the mod of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarketsNoobs/" target="_blank">/r/dnmnoobs</a>) for posting a few common questions to get this system running!</p>
