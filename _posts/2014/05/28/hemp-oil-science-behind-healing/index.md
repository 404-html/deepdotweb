    <p>Could it be possible that the ultimate cure all isn’t produced by GlaxoSmithKline or Pfizer but instead is produced naturally right here on this green earth? Hemp oil is being used all around the world to treat ailments and illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, Parkinson’s disease, Multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, AIDS, cancer and more. People are seeing miraculous things happen as a result of using this oil and more specifically cancer patients are curing themselves of the disease all together.</p>

    <p>Though we are led to believe that treatments such as radiation or chemotherapy are effective the truth is polar opposite. The fact of the matter is these type of treatments have no way of targeting only bad cells therefore many healthy cells must and will be destroyed in order to rid the bad cells. THC (active ingredient in marijuana) however heals the body in a much different way. When THC comes into contact with cancer cells it causes them to commit cellular suicide by self-digestion all while never harming the healthy cells.</p>
    <p>Another compound in the marijuana plant is CBD. CBD has proven to treat inflammation, pain, anxiety, spasms, psychosis, PTSD and more. This particular cannabinoid is not psychoactive unlike its counterpart, THC.</p>
    <p>To understand how Hemp oil has healed so many people one must first know what it is and its true relation to homeostasis. Simply put, hemp oil commonly referred to as Rick Simpson oil, cannabis oil, hash oil, or R.S.O is both CBD and THC in its concentrated form. It is the extraction process that is responsible for such high concentration and because of this its medicinal value is raised tenfold.</p>
    <p>Next, let’s take a look at the human body. Each and every person that is blessed to breath air has an endocannabinoid system within their body. Endocannabinoid system is defined as a group of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors in the brain that are involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory. These receptors are also found in organs, connective tissues, glands, and immune cells. So why do we need endocannabinoids? Well, endocannabinoids sole purpose is to aid the internal body in maintaining stability and balance. They are made by our body to activate the receptors that participate in every aspect of life.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5763" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hemp2.jpg" alt="hemp2" width="275" height="183" /></p>
    <p>Aside from the human body and a select few of animalsthe only other place we can find cannabinoids are in the Cannabis plant. With that being said wouldn’t it make sense for cannabis to be able to heal our bodies? It seems that we have internal connections tothis plant.By introducing hemp oil to our bodies we are create a surplus of endocannabinoids that will further stimulate internal equilibrium.</p>
    <p>I first discovered hemp oil when I attended a medical marijuana conference in 2010. There were eight guest speakers all of which had treated their illness with hemp oil. Four of them had successfully cured themselves of various cancers in stage 3 or 4. The other four had treated Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s and high blood pressure. While I watched the coordinators of the event prepare for the next speaker I wondered why they had placed a wooden step at the podium but within minutes I would find out. As the audience settled in for part two of the conference out runs a little blonde boy who was slowly followed by a man who looked identical to him.</p>
    <p>“Evan” was a six year old rambunctious boy who had been diagnosed with brain cancer and after failed treatments of chemotherapy his doctors delivered his parents the devastating news that there was nothing else they could do for him. Evan’s father had heard of hemp oil and knew that it was sold at a local dispensary that he frequented as a marijuana patient prior to his son’s diagnosis. After doing some research he determined that this was his son’s last chance at life so without the consent of his wife or doctors he began to put small amounts of oil on wooden tongue depressors and placing in his son’s mouth twice a dayWithin days Evan’s appetite had increased drastically and this was the first sign of hope but it only got better from there. When the doctors did another scan of his brain the tumor had decreased tremendously and the hospital staff thought they were witnessing a miracle when in fact his father had provided the oil that was curing him.</p>
    <p>Evan and his dad were there to give testimony to this wonderful oil as it had cured his dying son. There were about thirty other people there that day in the audience that too had their own successful testimonies and it was that day that I decided hemp oil would be my cure all. During the conference we had watched Rick Simpson’s documentary <em>Run from the Cure </em>and he stated that sixty grams is enough to cure most cancers and treat all other ailments so why is this information withheld and such a secret?</p>
    <p>It is both due to the works of lead pharmaceutical companies and the sheep mentality of man that the masses have not yet accepted the inevitable truths about hemp oil. It would not be in the best interest of these pill farms that a drug that cannot be patented but is a natural healer to be highly publicized. If the vast majority was to go against everything that society has been brainwashed to believe about marijuana and began to treat their ailments with hemp oil we would witness the destruction and demise of a billion dollar industry. For this reason these companies will continue to lobby for anti-marijuana laws and remain the primary machine for the false information that is spread concerning this magnificent medicine and its community.</p>
    <p>Due to obscene laws there are many people who do not have access to hemp oil even if they reside in one of the semi-legal states so they must resort to darknet markets in order to retrieve what could save their life. Many of the vendors on these markets understand that this oil is used as a treatment and in a world where testing products for purity is not only encouraged but implemented DNM have become a good source to obtain pure, uncut, finished oil. Street dealers typically are in it for the maximum profit therefore one must be careful when buying oil because they are aware that it is very unlikely that their product will ever be tested so they may produce the oil from marijuana leaves instead of buds which decreases the potency and medicinal value. Street dealers also tend to cut hemp oil with coconut oil which too decreases its potency. Vendors on the markets operate solely off reputation and reviews so they have more to lose if they cut it or do anything to diminish the quality because one buyer who decides to get an analysis done by one of the many labs that are willing to test samples (for a fee of course) could cause their sales to halt simply by posting the negative lab results. Buyers should always search forums and read reviews before purchasing from any vendor.</p>
    <p>If you find that hemp oil can help you then take the first step and educate yourself before you allow your physician to write you numerous prescriptions for pharmaceuticals. Do the research, apply the knowledge, spread the word.</p>
