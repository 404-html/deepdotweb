    <p>Put the Silk Road Drama Aside For a minute, it seems that the Black market reloaded forums &#8211; the only remains from Black market reloaded the marketplace who was <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/01/bmr-is-shutting-down/">shut down</a> near the end of 2013, was seized by the Iranian police (i had no idea you can host a website in Iran):</p>

    <p><a href="/imgs/2014/02/bmrseized.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4178" alt="bmrseized" src="/imgs/2014/02/bmrseized.png" width="1155" height="625" srcset="/imgs/2014/02/bmrseized.png 1155w, /imgs/2014/02/bmrseized-300x162.png 300w, /imgs/2014/02/bmrseized-1024x554.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1155px) 100vw, 1155px" /></a>Its pretty easy to assume its a fallout related to the arrest that occurred on Tuesday regarding <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/12/the-utopia-bust-details-prosecution-announcement/">utopia marketplaceÂ </a> As it was already stated that the same admins were running BMR and Utopia. The forum was the thing that was still active since BMR was shut down by the admin backopy 2 months ago. As far as we know, the admin of black market reloaded Backopy was NOT arrested so far &#8211; as he was still active on the forum after the Utopia arrests even earlier today and had posted a topic about the SR2.0 closure.</p>
