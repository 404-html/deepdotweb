    <p><strong>Quote</strong>:</p>
    <p>There has been a lot of confusion lately about how bitcoins are sent, where they go, and why they haven&#8217;t showed up in some peoples wallets in a timely fashion. This is just a quick guide/explanation about the process, to help answer any questions people may have.</p>
    <p>Congratulations, you just bought some bitcoins for your dark net purchase! the next step is obviously to get it to your Agora wallet. You put in the wallet address, complete a few security pop ups and hit the send button. Fantastic! Now its time to explain what happens while you&#8217;re waiting&#8230;</p>
    <p>Bitcoin is kind of like a giant game of pass the parcel. Except your parcel is a giant wad of cash and you&#8217;re trying to bribe Italian Mafia mobsters to pass it along the line to get it to its destination. And if anyone knows a mobster, they are not going to do it for free, unless they feel some overwhelming power of generosity, or they&#8217;re blind drunk&#8230;</p>
    <p>When you send coins from your wallet, you may be prompted to, or automatically be charged a fee. Its extremely small. usually about 0.4%. This is a processing fee so your payment can be registered and sent through the network. Once someone picks up your payment (these people (or computers) are called &#8220;miners&#8221;) they take a small percentage of that 0.4% fee you paid, and move your transaction onto the next group (this is called a &#8220;confirmation&#8221;). This process is repeated 4-8 times before you get your funds. Like rolling a ball along a Basketball court, you need to kick it a few times to get to the end.</p>
    <p>So back to my mobsters; You need to send your giant wad of money to your mobster buddy &#8220;Agora&#8221; (your wallet) on the opposite side of town without getting caught. You tell your other mobster buddy Tony (miner #1), to pass it along the gang members until it gets to Agora, and for his troubles, he can take $20 from the giant wad of cash. So, Tony gets the package, makes sure all the cash is there (confirmation #1), takes his $20 cut, and then passes it on to Joe (miner #2). He takes the package, makes sure all the cash is there (confirmation #2) takes his $20 cut, then passes it onto George (miner #3)&#8230; the process repeats itself until Agora finally gets his giant wad of cash.</p>
    <p>Now lets go back to the beginning for a second and change the circumstances. You need to send your giant wad of money to your mobster mate Agora. Except this time, you&#8217;re feeling a bit cheap, and tell your mobster buddy Tony to do it without taking a cut. Tony int too impressed by your offer. He says &#8220;he&#8217;ll think about it&#8221; and puts your money on the bottom of his to do list. I mean, he has other jobs to do that hes being paid for. He&#8217;s going to do them first before he gets the time to do yours&#8230;</p>
    <p>Tony finally finishes breaking knee caps and eating pasta and shit, and finally decides to hand your package over to Joe during dinner. Joe also isn&#8217;t impressed by the fact hes not getting paid to do this job, so keeps it in the back of his car for a couple of days, until he ends up at some mobster wedding and asks the god father for a favor, to pass on the cash to Agora for free.</p>
    <p><strong>Now back to bitcoins&#8230;</strong></p>
    <p>Bitcoins with no processing fees are going to move through the network slower, because miners are preprogrammed to make money. When they cant seek anymore &#8220;paid jobs&#8221; then they will move onto your bitcoin to confirm it and move it along. But as soon as a bitcoin payment with fees appear back in the network, they will mine and confirm those first, moving you to the bottom of the list. Hence why your payment will move slower through the system.</p>
    <p>So in conclusion, If you want your money quick, pay the mobsters, otherwise they&#8217;re going to find something better to do&#8230; Like eat pizza or something&#8230;</p>
