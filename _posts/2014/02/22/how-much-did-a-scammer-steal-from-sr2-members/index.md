<p>Someone mailed us today a great infographics (sort of) showing a calculation of how much was stolen from silk road 2 members by a scam vendor &#8211; the calculation was done by adding up all the bad feedback from silk road and posting some proofs using forum posts made by this vendor and all adds up to aroundÂ  $20,000</p>
<p>Later we saw that this was posted on reddit as well on this thread so you can join the discussion here:</p>
<p>http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ylbn8/proof_sr2_vendor_herby_stole_way_over_20000_from/</p>
<p>We have no idea about the full story behind this vendor and the scam he was running but this looks like a great piece of evidence about how much and how easy it is for scammers to flourish without being banned on some markets, and we hate this, so posting this is our humble contribution.
