<p dir="ltr">So it appears that these Seizures of Mt. Gox accounts in the usa were no only a move against Bitcoins or a regulatory thing, but was an integral part of the ongoing investigation against Silk road and the other black markets, as it was <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2013/11/18/ice-statement-record-senate-committee-homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs" target="_blank">stated clearly</a> by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) states,</p>
<p><em>“In May 2013, through an interagency taskforce led by ICE in Baltimore, Maryland, three U.S. bank accounts associated with what was then the world’s largest bitcoin exchanger, Japan-based Mt.Gox, which was moving approximately $60 million per month into a number of Internet-based hidden black markets operating on the Tor network, including Silk Road, were seized for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1960, operating a money service business in the United States without a license. The bulk of the funds were associated with the illicit purchase of drugs, firearms, and child pornography.”</em></p>
<p>The genesis block website posted a great article on this matter, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The testimony clearly draws a direct connection between Mt. Gox and Silk Road to the tune of tens of millions of dollars per month, yet still cites a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1960 (money transmitting regulations) as the impetus for the actual account seizures. When a seemingly innocuous section from the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/184579094/Virtual-Currency-Response-LettersFederal-Agencies-Respond-to-Homeland-Security-Committee-Questions-on-Digital-Currencies" target="_blank">testimony</a> by the Department of Homeland Security is added to this, the underlying motive for the seizures become clearer. In particular, the DHS states,</p></blockquote>
<p>Quoting again:<br/>
<em>“The USSS is responsible for the forensics and cyber analysis in this ongoing criminal investigation </em>[of Silk Road]<em> and, along with our interagency partners, will attempt to identify the site’s origin and the identity of the site administrator. As a result of this ongoing investigation, approximately $5.5 million has been seized by the USSS and ICE-HSI.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>So the government DO know where some of the Bitcoins are coming from or going to? Apparently so. </strong></li>
<li><strong>They Do have the forensic tools to track Bitcoin transactions into some of the hidden sites &#8211; and that was a year ago.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This makes it even a better reason to tumble your coins before placing them in or out of any hidden site.</strong></p>
