<p>Found this nice infographics posted by the user <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/thirtysix36" target="_blank">thirtysix36</a> on the Silk Road sub Reddit &#8211; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1w33c2/infographic_a_comprehensive_guide_to_buying_drugs/" target="_blank">here</a>,  As he said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey all. First time visitor. A couple of friends were asking about how to use Silk Road, and of course they had two million questions because it can be a pretty in-depth process. Maybe you are in the same situation.</p>
<p>So, I decided to make an infographic. It covers the entire process step-by-step, its easy to understand, and it is pretty much everything I have learned in the last year from about 50 transactions on SR1.0, 2.0 and Sheep. There&#8217;s a lot of good nuggets of information here that can really only be learned from experience.</p>

<p>Spread it around. Hope it helps you and your friends. :)</p>
<p>I saw another dude post his online guide recently. Spread his shit around too! The more information the better!</p></blockquote>
