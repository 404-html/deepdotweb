<p>Just came across this interesting thread on SR2 forum, I must admit i still did not have the chance to contact them and ask for more details about this service but i like the idea so i though i should mention it and maybe we will get some reports from people who contacted this lawyer for advice (http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=45693.0;topicseen):</p>
<p><strong>The thread was as follows:</strong></p>

<p>Are you currently relying on attorney-client privilege to protect yourself?</p>
<p>Legal professional privilege (attorney-client privilege) is only afforded to existing clients of a practicing lawyer and does not apply if there is ongoing illegal activity or the advice being sought is used for the furtherance of a crime. Under attorney-client privilege an attorney cannot be compelled to testify against a client, nor can their confidential communications be subpoenaed for evidence but in reality what procedural guidelines does your attorney follow for the safekeeping of confidential client correspondence? A locked filing cabinet perhaps?</p>
<p>Onion Law by using PGP encryption and not requiring personal information affords a greater level or protection to clients, contact us today for an independent and confidential consultation: <strong>onionlaw@secure-mail.biz</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So in case you have some legal questions service you can try this and let us know how it went and how much it cost.</p>
