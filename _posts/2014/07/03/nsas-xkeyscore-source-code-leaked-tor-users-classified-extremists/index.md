    <p>As it was published by <a href="http://rt.com/news/170208-nsa-spies-tor-users/">RT</a>:</p>
    <blockquote><p>The NSA has been revealed to mark and consider potential &#8220;extremists&#8221; all users of the internet anonymizer service Tor. Among those are hundreds of thousands of privacy concerned people like journalists, lawyers and rights activists.</p>
    <p>Searching for encryption software like the Linux-based operating system Tails also places you on the NSA grid, as Lena Kampf, Jacob Appelbaum and John Goetz <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/nsa-xkeyscore-100.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> on the German site Tagesschau. The report is based on analysis of the source code of the software used by NSA’s electronic surveillance program XKeyscore.</p>
    <p>Tor is a system of servers, which routes user requests through a layer of secured connections to make it impossible to identify a user’s IP from the addresses of the websites he/she visits. The network of some 5,000 is operated by enthusiasts and used by hundreds of thousands of privacy-concerned people worldwide. Some of them live in countries with oppressive regimes, which punish citizens for visiting websites they deem inappropriate.</p>

    <p>If you have ever considered supporting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tor?src=hash">#Tor</a>, now is an excellent time to start. Privacy matters, even yours</p>

    <p>But merely visiting Tor project’s <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">website</a> puts you on the NSA’s red list, the report says. But more importantly it monitors connections to so-called Directory Authorities, the eight servers, which act as gateways for the entire system.</p>
    <p>The NSA was particularly surveilling German-based Tor Directory Authorities. One is operated by the Germany-based hacker group Chaos Computer Club, the other by computer science student Sebastian Hahn, who told journalists that the revelation is “<em>shocking</em>.”</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
    <p>We have published several new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSA?src=hash">#NSA</a> stories today: <a href="http://t.co/oBxR0lDWjY">http://t.co/oBxR0lDWjY</a> <a href="http://t.co/WVeaqMeoCe">http://t.co/WVeaqMeoCe</a> More information coming soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/germany?src=hash">#germany</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/usa?src=hash">#usa</a></p>

    <p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
    <p>The system itself doesn’t appear to be compromised however, but the NSA gets data like IP addresses of those using it, enough to cross-reference them with other databases the agency has access to.</p>
    <p>There are indications that NSA may be collecting not only the metadata of the people on the list, but also read their email exchanges with Tor.</p>
    <p>An interest in Tor is not the only way to make it to NSA’s watch list. Even web searches for other encryption software makes you a target as well, the report said.</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
    <p>How the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSA?src=hash">#NSA</a>&#39;s XKeyScore tags Tor users as &quot;extremist&quot; <a href="http://t.co/GNBLPJCojG">http://t.co/GNBLPJCojG</a> more: <a href="https://t.co/PKQAZljALj">https://t.co/PKQAZljALj</a></p>

    <p>Disturbingly, NSA programmer comments in the source code label those picked up by the American system “<em>extremists</em>.”</p>
    <p>The report says XKeyscore marks all people that hit the red light on its grid, with the exception of those connecting from members of the Five Eyes, a group of countries cooperating in intelligence gathering, namely the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>It was not immediately clear how the authors of the publication obtained the source code of XKeyscore software, but the existence of the system was <a href="http://rt.com/news/xkeyscore-nsa-snowden-prism-858/" target="_blank">revealed</a> in 2013 through documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>
    <p>Ironically, Tor was originally created for the US Navy and still receives a major part of its funding from the US government &#8211; the same government that considers its users &#8220;extremists&#8221;.</p>
    <p>Anonymous experts <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/07/03/if-you-read-boing-boing-the-n.html" target="_blank">told</a> Boing Boing that the new leak may come from a second source, not Edward Snowden as nothing of the kind had ever been seen this in the original Snowden documents or intended publications</p></blockquote>
