    <p>Most research studies on darknet marketplaces, or <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/06/everything-always-wanted-know-drug-cryptomarkets/">cryptomarkets</a>, focus on the sales of illegal drugs. Most studies conducted during the past few years have provided minimal information on the magnitude and scope of trading of other forms of products on darknet marketplaces, including tobacco trading. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17440572.2019.1569520?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">A recently published paper</a> aimed at analyzing the volume of tobacco sales taking place on cryptomarkets, and the different forms of tobacco products being offered on these marketplaces. Throughout this article, we will overview some of the interesting information provided by this paper.</p>

    <p><strong>Collection and description of data related to tobacco trafficking on cryptomarkets:</strong></p>
    <p>The study collected data during the fall of the year 2016 from 14 cryptomarkets, via DARACRYPTO, a software tool that crawls all pages of a given website and then extracts relevant data in order to build a database.</p>
    <p>476 product listings related to tobacco were identified on the monitored darknet marketplaces. These product listings received 263 buyers&#8217; reviews within the 30-day period preceding the data collection, denoting that 263 tobacco related sales were completed. These sales generated $6,304 during the same period.</p>

    <p><strong>Table (1): Types and distribution of tobacco related products listed on cryptomarkets</strong></p>
    <p>Table (1) shows the different forms and distribution of tobacco related product listings identified in the study. Thirteen different product categories were created. Rolling tobacco is usually sold in grams over cryptomarkets. The cigarettes category included listings with a large number of cigarettes, mainly in cartridges with 200 units. Many recognized cigarette brands are sold on darknet marketplaces including Marlboro, L &amp; M, Camel, Lucky Strike, Winston, Chesterfield, and Vogue. The cigars category includes products identified as of Cuban origin. The e-cigarettes category includes different types of electronic rechargeable cigarettes that use cartridges or e-liquid. Some forms of e-liquid contain nicotine, while others do not.</p>
    <p>The categories associated with the biggest amount of sales were rolling tobacco and cigarettes. 40% of the revenue generated from tobacco sales could be linked to listings represented by the cigarettes category. E-cigarettes represented 20% of the listings and generated 11% of the overall tobacco related revenue. Listings including rolling tobacco represented 10% and generated 14% of the total tobacco related revenue. Even though 5% of all tobacco listings included e-cigarettes, they generated 21% of the revenue.</p>
    <p>88% of all product listings stated the country which the sold products were shipped from. This information is important for local buyers who do not want their shipped tobacco to go through the customs. 39% of all products were shipped from Europe, accounting for 44% of all tobacco related revenues. The UK was the most active country in Europe and the second all across the world. 33% of all tobacco products were shipped from the United States, accounting for 40% of the total revenues. The study identified 4,295 cryptomarket vendors, of which 2% listed various tobacco related products.</p>
    <p>The 476 product listings of tobacco related products represented around 1% of all listings identified on the studied cryptomarkets. During the period of the study, $6,304 were generated via sales of tobacco products, which accounts for 0.03% of the total market earnings during the same period of around $18 million.</p>
    <p><strong>Implications of the collected data and the shift of tobacco trafficking to the dark web:</strong></p>
    <p>The number of sales and the earnings generated via tobacco sales on darknet marketplaces are rather difficult to precisely estimate, namely because some sales may not lead to publicly visible feedback. It was estimated that around 80% of all completed transactions lead to a publicly visible feedback. Results of this study denote that tobacco <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/11/14/multi-homing-vendors-and-loyal-buyers-on-darknet-marketplaces/">vendors on darknet marketplaces</a> are important participants, who account for only 2% of the total number of vendors. The low number of tobacco product listings on cryptomarkets should not keep us from monitoring this phenomenon, as evidence suggests that more traffickers are shifting from Clearnet marketplaces to darknet marketplaces.</p>
    <p>The low number of tobacco product listings can be explained, at least partly, by the nature of vendors involved in tobacco trading. Individual vendors mostly lack the needed inventories and resources to be able to consistently fuel tobacco sales on large marketplaces such as cryptomarkets. Their supply is likely too irregular to be able to fill all customers&#8217; orders. On the other hand, large international businesses involved in tobacco trading have little to gain via <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2019/02/08/research-business-strategies-adopted-across-darknet-marketplaces/">utilizing darknet marketplaces as a distribution channel</a>. These businesses usually have well organized distribution networks that can reach an enormous customer base. Even though darknet marketplaces can potentially increase their sales via expanding their customer base, there is no indication that customers will presently be available there to purchase their products. This represents a dilemma, as without adequate supply, customers are not likely to be interested in purchasing tobacco products over cryptomarkets. On the other hand, with insufficient demand levels, sellers will also not be interested in investing in a relatively notorious online portal, the dark web, which can potentially limit the interest of some consumers.</p>
    <p>New regulations imposed on tobacco trading could however boost the volume of illicit trading of tobacco on darknet marketplaces. Also, changes in the control of tobacco and rising taxes have fueled the creation of a black market for various forms of tobacco products. All these forces may catalyze the growth of a lucrative tobacco market on darknet marketplaces and thorough research will be necessary to estimate the potential of this emerging market.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></p>
    <p>Even though the current magnitude of tobacco trafficking on darknet marketplaces is negligible, this research study has helped us understand the main highlights of this activity taking place on the dark web. Evidence suggests that the volume of sales of tobacco on cryptomarkets is likely to increase during the next few years.</p>
