    <p>A man and two women were arrested for allegedly distributing drugs all over Australia through the dark web and the Australian post. The three are believed to have sold drugs worth over $17 million and to have established themselves as the largest dark web drug vendor in Australia over time. The man allegedly led the group and had a vendor’s account in an undisclosed dark web marketplace while the two women prepared, packaged and distributed drugs ordered through the dark web.</p>

    <p>According to <a href="https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/news?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGNzUxNTguaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D">a statement released by the NSW Police</a>, the case against 25-year-old Cody Ronald Ward from Callala Beach, 24-year-old Shanese Koullias from Callala Bay, and 20-year-old Patricia Koullias from Quakers Hill was investigated by Strike Force Royden. Strike Force Royden was established in April 2018 by detectives of the State Crime Command’s Criminal Group Squad and tasked with the fight against the distribution of illicit drugs in New South Wales.</p>
    <p>Over the course of its investigations, the strike force reportedly identified the trio’s dark web drug distribution operation. Further investigations led to the discovery that the trio operated from the South Coast. The investigations against the trio were intensified when the strike force partnered with detectives from the South Coast Police District and the Cybercrime Squad. Heading towards the completion of its investigations Strike Force Royden sought the help of the Australian Post in its bid to confiscate drug packages sent by the trio. On February 13, detectives from the strike force with the support of the Australian Post intercepted 85 <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/package/">drug packages</a> believed to have been posted by the trio. The interception led to the seizure of undisclosed quantities of a wide variety of drugs.</p>
    <p>The intercepted drugs provided the detectives with evidence that enabled them to acquire five search warrants served against properties owned by the trio. The detectives began the raids on the morning of February 14 and searched four residences in Callala Bay and Callala Beach and one in Quakers Hill. The raids resulted in the seizure of 100,000 LSD pills, 2.5 kgs of white powder suspected of being cocaine, diazepam and amphetamine, 200g of MDMA, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/xanax/">Xanax</a> packaged as candy, and yellow and blue pills also suspected to be illicit drugs. The detectives also seized documents, a laptop, mobile phones, mass storage devices, sealing and labelling equipment, money counters, and $80,000 in cash. The raid also resulted in the police seizing three cars – a Mercedes-Benz, a Lexus, and a Ford Falcon, all allegedly owned by the trio. The police also found a fourth car, a Maserati, whose owner is unknown.</p>
    <p>After the raids, Ward, Shanese, and Patricia were arrested and detained in the Nowra Police Station without bail. Following the arrests, the police analysed the seized electronic evidence, leading to the discovery of cryptocurrency wallets and the seizure of cryptocurrencies found in the wallets. The detectives reportedly found that the trio had transacted over $17 million through the cryptocurrency wallets. The police expect to uncover more transactions and more incriminating evidence from continued analysis of the seized electronic devices.</p>
    <p>After announcing the arrests, the Acting Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said that the NSW Police Force is well equipped in the fight against dark web drug trafficking. Smith concluded by saying that the coordination by law enforcement groups involved in the investigation shows that <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/dark/">the dark web</a> does not give criminals a perfect hiding place. On behalf of the Australian Post, the General Manager in charge of security, Kevin Zuccato, said that the postal service provider is open to cooperation with both local and international law enforcement agencies in the fight against drug trafficking.</p>
    <p>On February 15, the trio was presented before Magistrate Gabriel Fleming in the Nowra Local Court and charged. Ward was charged with six counts of distributing commercial quantities of illicit drugs, possession of proceeds of crime, and overseeing the operations of an organized crime group. Ward’s attorney, Brett Ford, did not apply for bail, and as a result, Ward will remain in custody awaiting his next appearance in court on April 12.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Shanese was charged with six counts of distributing commercial amounts of illegal drugs and being a member of an organized crime group, while Patricia was charged with five counts of distributing commercial quantities of illicit drugs and being part of an organized crime group. Shanese and Patricia were represented by Rosie Lambert, who did not apply for their release on bail.</p>
