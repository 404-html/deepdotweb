    <p>An announcement made by the US Department of Justice disclosed that a multi-year, multi-agency joint operation made up of U.S. law enforcement agencies led by the U.S. Secret Service and other international agencies <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-and-international-law-enforcement-dismantle-online-organized-crime-ring">dismantled a ring of fraudsters that operated from Romania</a>. The ring allegedly had 20 members, 16 of which were foreigners. The ring targeted American victims through online auctions after which they would launder the acquired funds using bitcoin.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28482" src="/imgs/2019/02/word-image-25.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2019/02/word-image-25.jpeg 660w, /imgs/2019/02/word-image-25-300x150.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
    <p>Two separate indictments were filed against the ring members in Lexington, Kentucky. The indictments charged 15 Romanians and 1 Bulgarian. The first indictment by a federal jury submitted on July 5, 2018, charged 15 foreigners with aggravated identity theft, money laundering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and with RICO conspiracy. In total, the indictment had 24 counts. The charged individuals include <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/12/29/coinflux-ceo-arrested-in-romania-for-alleged-crimes-in-the-us/">Vlad Calin Nistor, a Coinflux CEO</a>, and Rossen Iossifov, the owner of R G Coins, a cryptocurrency exchange firm in Bulgaria. The second indictment was filed on February 6, 2019, it had 11 counts and charged a Romanian and four Americans for their involvement in the fraudulent activities.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28483" src="/imgs/2019/02/word-image-26.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2019/02/word-image-26.jpeg 660w, /imgs/2019/02/word-image-26-300x150.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
    <p>According to the indictment, the Romanian-based members of the ring posted non-existent vehicles for sale on online auction and sale sites such as eBay. The ring members used stolen American identities to create accounts on the online sale sites and used them to post the non-existent high-value goods. After posting the goods, they would use an accompanying story intended to convince buyers, such as claiming to be a military officer planning to make a quick sale before the deployment date. On completion of the fraudulent transactions, the American members of the ring would receive the funds on behalf of the gang. After receiving the funds, the Americans then converted them into <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a> and then sent the bitcoin to the Romanians. On receiving the bitcoin, the Romanians allegedly converted it into local currency using either Coinflux or R G Coins with the help of Nistor and Iossifov respectively.</p>
    <p>The indictment disclosed some of the fraudulent measures taken by the ring members to ensure the targeted victims sent funds. One of the ring members, 28-year-old Ionat Ciobanu from Romania, presented himself as an Air Force Sergeant. He used the email address, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cda7b8a9a4b9a5a1aca3a8f5ff8daaa0aca4a1e3aea2a0">[email&#160;protected]</a>, to send emails to victims regarding the sale of cars, at the end of the email he would sign as ‘Sgt. Judith Lane’. Ciobanu also created a Facebook account for Judith Lane and posted two ads announcing the sale of vehicles.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, 35-year-old Marius-Dorin Cernat allegedly sent invoices that resembled legitimate ones posted by eBay Motors. The invoices had payment instructions and messages that assured the victims that eBay would hold the payment until the victims received and inspected the item sold to them. In the invoices, Cernat would include the phone number for eBay Motors Support Department and the email address, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e38681829aa393918c808690908a8d84ce908680969186cd808c8e">[email&#160;protected]</a>, to ultimately convince the victims.</p>
    <p>One of the ring members, 34-year-old Adrian Mitan, was subjected to more <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2019/02/01/research-using-cryptocurrency-in-money-laundering/">money laundering</a> charges in a separate indictment filed on February 7th. Mitan allegedly defrauded Americans using credit card phishing as well as brute-force attack schemes. Mitan allegedly used phishing attacks to acquire the credit card information of US citizens. To obtain any information that he did not get through the phishing attacks he would then hack into American businesses’ electronic systems and carry out brute force attacks on point-of-sale systems. He would then give the credit card information to his US associates who would acquire funds from the compromised accounts and send Mitan his share of the proceeds in bitcoin.</p>
    <p>During the announcement, Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkwoski said that the arrests of and charges filed against the ring members proved that the DoJ&#8217;s Criminal Division is always ready to partner with other law enforcement agencies to arrest and prosecute all those who intend to defraud American Citizens regardless of where they reside. On his part, U.S. Attorney Robert M. Duncan Jr. of the Eastern District of Kentucky said that the sort of cooperation witnessed in investigating the case is essential for the effective disruption of organized cybercrime that leads to losses in millions of dollars to US citizens.</p>
    <p>Secret Service director Randolph Alles said that the case indicated that the Secret Service has ‘transnational investigative capabilities.’ The announcement also disclosed that 12 of the foreign suspects had already been extradited to the US. The trials against the ring members are set for June 18 and August 7, 2019.</p>
