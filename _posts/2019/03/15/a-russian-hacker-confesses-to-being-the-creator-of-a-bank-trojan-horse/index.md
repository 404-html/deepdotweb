    <p>A 33-year-old male citizen from Russia who is responsible for affecting people’s computers and laptops with a Trojan virus has confessed to the crime in a Federal Court in Manhattan. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-national-author-of-neverquest-banking-trojan-pleads-guilty/">Stanislav V. Lisov created the malware known as NeverQuest</a> and programmed it to infect people’s devices when they accessed various online platforms.</p>
    <p><strong><img class="wp-image-28637" src="/imgs/2019/03/word-image-9.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2019/03/word-image-9.jpeg 660w, /imgs/2019/03/word-image-9-300x150.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/06/23/14-year-old-boy-arrested-japan-creating-ransomware-virus/">The virus</a>, also known as Vawtrack or Snifula, has infected a large number of devices in Germany, Spain, France, and the U.S. since its creation in 2014. It is solely responsible for the loss of millions of dollars from the bank accounts of its victims.</p>
    <p>The Justice Department reports that Lisov, who referred to himself as Black or Blackf online, created <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/10/14/kelihos-botnet-operator-pleads-guilty-to-id-trading-on-darkweb/">the virus as a botnet</a>. This allowed him to create a big network of computers infected with the virus. Security systems of the computers would be compromised allowing him to access and steal privileged information, send spam, and intercept the devices’ connections.</p>
    <p>U.S. law enforcement officials also report that he would rent and manage the core servers that formed the cornerstone of the Trojan horse. The servers were coded to infect computers, secure a connection, and then send information from the affected devices back to the servers. Lisov managed the virus for almost three years from midyear 2012 until the beginning of 2015.</p>
    <p>According to William Sweeney, the FBI Deputy Director, Lisov would sell part of the personal identification information he stole to impersonators. When bought, it would be used to <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2019/01/22/multi-agency-force-brings-down-dark-web-identity-theft-from-douglas-county/">create fake identification cards or credit and debit cards</a>. Thousands of people lost their personal information and complained of having noticed suspicious activities in their accounts or having higher dues for credit cards than they had planned for.</p>
    <p>The Trojan horse was also programmed to access logging in data from victims’ computers the moment they accessed online banking systems. This data would be sent to the main servers where Lisov would use it to access bank accounts and perform huge transactions. A number of banks reported fraudulent activities that siphoned more than $850,000 from user accounts.</p>
    <p>His arrest came on January 13, 2017, after police investigations into cybercrime led to him. U.S. officials had been working on the case since 2014. Their efforts finally led them to the virus servers which were strategically placed in Germany and France. Authorities seized the servers and found them to contain all the data stolen from Lisov’s victims.</p>
    <p>He was apprehended together with his wife at El Prat airport in Barcelona where they had gone to return a car they had hired for their vacation. Before their arrest, the two planned to leave for Lyon in France to meet up with friends after clearing the car.</p>
    <p>His wife was taken into custody for being an alleged accomplice in the crime. When interviewed, she claimed that her husband was a software administrator and a web designer employed at a certain company based in Taganrog back in Russia. Moreover, Russian administrators came to his defence, claiming that Spanish authorities wrongfully apprehended him and that they considered it more of an international abduction than a criminal arrest.</p>
    <p>A few months after his arrest, an agreement was made between Spanish and U.S. authorities that Lisov’s case be handed over to the U.S. Thereafter, he was prosecuted in a court of law in New York City at the start of 2018.</p>
    <p>On February 23 this year, Lisov confessed to being the creator of the virus, running it and also infecting thousands of online users. He was charged with a single count of conspiring in the hacking of computers.</p>
    <p>He currently awaits his final hearing which will be held on the 27th of June this year. His case will be heard by Judge Valerie E. Caproni of the Southern District Court of New York. Lisov faces a penalty of up to five years imprisonment.</p>
    <p>Before his arrest, NeverQuest was the second-best bank malware after Zeus. NeverQuest accounted for about 17% of all cybercrimes, while Zeus accounted for 28%. After the arrest, officials shut down the servers and NeverQuest activities significantly reduced. Presently, they account for only 2% of cyber-attacks.</p>
    <p>Authorities state that his arrest should serve as a warning to similar criminals who make bank accounts unsafe for people’s money and cost the banks large sums of cash in compensation for stolen money.</p>
