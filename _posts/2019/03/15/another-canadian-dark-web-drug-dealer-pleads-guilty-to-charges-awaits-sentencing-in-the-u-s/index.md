    <p>Christopher Bantli, a Canadian who pleaded guilty to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xwb4e7/more-canadians-are-facing-jail-in-the-us-for-dealing-fentanyl-on-the-dark-web">conspiracy to import fentanyl</a> and other controlled substances into the United States, now awaits a lengthy sentence of up to 10 years in prison after a court appearance in Washington, DC this month. The 39-year-old entered guilty pleas before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson for the District of Columbia after having been extradited to the United States from Canada after his indictment in the District of Columbia.</p>
    <p>According to court documents, Bantli ran an online drug business through the dark web and was active on numerous dark web sites including the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/12/30/german-man-sentenced-to-probation-for-buying-guns-on-alphabay/">now-defunct site AlphaBay</a> and Canadasunshinemart.com. He reportedly advertised, imported, and distributed controlled substances such as synthetic opioids and powerful fentanyl analogs from November 2015 up to September 8, 2016, and took his payment in Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>A web archive for the then AlphaBay market shows the Calgary native, under the moniker “Canadasunshine,” putting up ads for “World Famous Xanax Candies” which were selling for $1.20 per milligram and U-47700, a strong synthetic opioid, with 100 mg going for $13. Online evidence found on this case revealed how bounteous his sales were. He made almost 1,998 sales on Silk Road alone under a parody account called “CalgaryDealer.” Bantli used the dark web marketplace to buy and resell his illicit drugs until the site was shut down, according to court records.</p>
    <p>“The feedback section of Canadasunshine’s vendor page on AlphaBay indicated that the defendant completed more than 131 sales of controlled substances on that website,” the documents state. It was stated in court that, “The defendant also previously used the hidden marketplaces Silk Road, Agora, and Evolution to distribute controlled substances.”</p>
    <p>Bantli now is the latest addition to a long list of Canadian dark web drug dealers targeted by U.S. authorities with assistance from the Canadian law enforcement. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/09/07/canadian-man-accused-of-selling-fentanyl-on-alphabay-and-dream/">James Ellingson was busted last year</a> in Vancouver on U.S. charges for conspiring to import heroin, cocaine, meth and other illicit drugs, as well as money laundering, all through the aid of the dark web. Ellingson, just like Bantli, hid behind the moniker “Marijuanaismymuse” on many dark web platforms, notable amongst them being Silk Road. Ellingson made millions through his illegal dark web drug trade and even was in direct contact with the founder, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/10/23/ross-ulbrichts-petition-signed-by-maine-state-senator-and-u-s-senate-candidate/">Ross Ulbricht</a>, who is now serving a life sentence in deferral prison.</p>
    <p>Another victim of the U.S. and Canadian Law enforcement’s operation to crack down dark web dealers is Robert Kiessling. The 40-year-old, also a Calgary native, was arrested in Kelowna, a city in the south of Canada’s British Columbia province, with his arrest being part of the results of a U.S. online drug trafficking investigation called “Operation Darkness Falls.” Kiessling’s arrest came after a tip to U.S. law enforcement agents from The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, revealing his identity as the one behind the username “DougFish44,” who was the third-largest fentanyl vendor in North America.</p>
    <p>According to a joint statement submitted by the narcotic and dangerous drugs section of the U.S. Department of Justice, Bantli, in a bid to support his distribution enterprise, turned his Calgary apartment into a drug laboratory and an establishment for orders placed on his AlphaBay vendor page. His drug laboratory contained drug analogs including cutting agents, a pill press, packaging, and many controlled substances. Bantli also used Canadian and U.S. mail to distribute his illicit drugs to his customers.</p>
    <p>Additional court documents revealed how one of Bantli’s shipments was sent to a DEA undercover agent in D.C. The U-4770 was shaped into candy and contained detailed instructions as well as a warning on how to use it; it stated, “U-47700 is approximately seven times more potent than morphine. Use care and start with tiny doses.”</p>
    <p>Reports from the Calgary Police Service stated that Bantli appeared under the radar of their cybercrime team during an operation aimed at combating dark web drug trafficking in 2016. They then notified U.S. law enforcement agents. Bantli was subsequently arrested by Calgary Police in August 2016 and received two dozen drug trafficking and possession charges. He was, however, released on bail, but his seven drug charges by U.S. law enforcement stuck.</p>
    <p>His sentencing is scheduled for May 29 this year before Judge Berman Jackson.</p>
