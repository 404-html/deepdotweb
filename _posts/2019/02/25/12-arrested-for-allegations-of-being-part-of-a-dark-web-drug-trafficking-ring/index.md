    <p>Twelve people were arrested in Europe on February 1st for an allegedly being part of a <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/9201-police-bust-dutch-german-drug-trafficking-ring">drug trafficking ring known as OCG</a>. The Dutch-German group was primarily composed of people of Afghan and Dutch origin. Individuals in the group were deployed to various places and given various tasks to perform, a move which made it more difficult to track them down.<img class="wp-image-28449 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2019/02/word-image-21.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2019/02/word-image-21.jpeg 660w, /imgs/2019/02/word-image-21-300x150.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
    <p>According to the police report, they would market the drugs on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">the dark web</a> and then deliver their products through <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2019/01/22/dark-web-drug-dealer-pleads-guilty-to-selling-cocaine-through-u-s-mail/">postal office services</a> to customers all over the world. The group dealt a wide variety of drugs including heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, ecstasy, and MDMA. According to Europol, customers would place their orders via the darknet markets and pay using cryptocurrencies. The drugs ordered would be prepared and packaged in the Netherlands, after which they would be sent to Germany for international distribution. Members of the ring specifically assigned to work in the area would distribute the drug envelopes worldwide through post and mail services.</p>
    <p>Following this arrest, police obtained warrants to search ten private residences and businesses located at the border between the Dutch and Germany. 40kg of amphetamine and a kilogram of ecstasy were seized. In addition, multiple electronic appliances, including mobile phones and computers, documents, and cash worth more than $11,000 were taken into police custody.</p>
    <p>This arrest comes just after police seized cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, MDMA and ecstasy drugs with a street value of more than $450,000 during their investigations into the group.</p>
    <p>The ring began its cross borders operations in 2018. Later that year, a joint investigation team (JIT) was formed to enable authorities to promptly and safely share information and evidence gathered on OCT. The joint operation involved the German Customs Investigation Office, the Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service, the Dutch Specialized Prosecution Office for Fraud and Environmental Crime and the German Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office.</p>
    <p>Europol supported the operation by deploying a mobile office for investigations and forensic research while Eurojust provided the finances required and facilitated cooperation between national authorities. Europol experts would then investigate all data obtained from the darknet and virtual currency accounts.</p>
    <p>Out of the twelve arrested, four members of the ring already had arrest warrants in Europe. Apart from the allegations of international drug dealing, police also brought the group in for suspicions of engaging in money laundering of the profits obtained from drug trafficking.</p>
    <p>German and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2019/01/02/dutch-police-seize-10000-ecstasy-pills-in-dark-web-vendor-raid/">Dutch authorities</a> continue to heighten their fight against drug traffickers and drug cartels. As part of this fight, law enforcement has employed experts in the field of cybercrime to examine all information obtained the dark web sites and digital currency accounts. This, they say, will enable them to obtain information crucial to the apprehension of more suspects.</p>
    <p>Increase in the distribution of drugs via the mail has been of rising concern. Europol is able to offer a wide range of specialized operational support services to curb such criminal activities. They also have set partnerships with other authorities, a cooperation that has been useful in disrupting this criminal group.</p>
