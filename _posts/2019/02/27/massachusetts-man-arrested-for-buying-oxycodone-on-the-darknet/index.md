    <p>Andrew King, a 29 year old man from Plymouth, Massachusetts, is being <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/08/plymouth-man-who-ordered-oxycodone-over-dark-web-arraigned-drug-charges/RvNBfj0MBQUh9MZ7hQMJDO/story.html">accused</a> of buying hundreds of oxycodone pills from a vendor operating on a darknet market, which were imported from the Medellin region of Colombia. The package had been sent using the carrier DHL and was intercepted by law enforcement agents from Customs and Border Protection, a branch of the federal Department of Homeland Security. Law enforcement claims the package weighed 22.2 grams and contained 100 40mg oxycodone pills. Oxycodone is an opioid pain killer which is found in pharmaceutical preparations such as OxyContin, Percocet, and Percodan. Special agents from Homeland Security Investigations, which is also a branch of the federal <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/dhs/">Department of Homeland Security</a>, recently notified law enforcement agents from the Massachusetts state police’s Commonwealth Interstate Narcotics Reduction Enforcement Team – South (CINRET-South) about the intercepted package.</p>
    <p>The investigation only began this month; however, this is not the first time state law enforcement officials have arrested Andrew King of Plymouth. King had previously been arrested in Plymouth Beach and was charged with simple possession of heroin back in 2013, when he was 23 years of age. The current investigation into Andrew King’s alleged crimes was the result of cooperation between the agencies of the Department of Homeland Security, including Customs and Border Protections, Homeland Security Investigations, the Massachusetts state police’s CINRET-South task force, the Plymouth Police Department, and detectives from the Plymouth County District Attorney’s Office. On Thursday, February 7<sup>th</sup> of this year, Massachusetts state troopers and local police officers raided the house King is alleged to have had the package sent to. An undercover Massachusetts state trooper disguised as a DHL deliveryman conducted a controlled delivery to the house in Plymouth. Around approximately 3:40pm, the state and local law enforcement agents executed a search warrant on the property immediately after Andrew King retrieved the package and returned into the house. Law enforcement agents allege that, in addition to the package of 100 40mg oxycodone pills, they also discovered amounts of heroin, Suboxone, and Subutex at the property. Law enforcement agents also seized a laptop computer, cell phones, and a digital scale from the property.</p>
    <p>This case shows that while federal law enforcement agencies in the United States may not have the resources to prosecute everyone who sends or receives packages of illegal products purchased on darknet markets that are shipped in the mail or by private carriers, they tip off state and local law enforcement who may choose to prosecute the cases under state law. Previously, we have <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/12/20/classified-documents-show-nsa-secretly-helped-convict-people-us-courts/">reported on</a> how the United States intelligence community also tips off federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and how law enforcement agencies sometimes use a process called parallel construction to conceal the source that initiated the investigation to deceive the court and the accused. It is important to note that while packages sent and received domestically within the United States through the United States Postal Service, or through private carriers such as DHL, FedEx, and UPS, are generally protected from unreasonable searches and seizures under the 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment of the United States Constitution; however, packages which must travel across international borders do not have the same 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment protection from unreasonable searches.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement are charging Andrew King with one count of trafficking a Class A drug, oxycodone, one count of possession of a Class A drug, subsequent offense, heroin, one count of possession of a Class B drug, subsequent offense, buprenorphine (Suboxone and Subutex), Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy Cruz said that after agents from Customs and Border Protection intercepted the package, further investigation revealed that a series of suspicious packages had been delivered to the same address since August of last year. King was arraigned in Plymouth District Court on Friday February 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>
