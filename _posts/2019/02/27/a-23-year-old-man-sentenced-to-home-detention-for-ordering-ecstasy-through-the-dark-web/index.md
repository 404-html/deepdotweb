    <p>A 23-year-old man from Napier, New Zealand, was sentenced to home detention after he was found guilty of three counts of importing ecstasy ordered through the dark web. Like the majority of those who purchase illicit items through the dark web, he was arrested after customs authorities intercepted two of his drug packages. He allegedly ordered the drugs on behalf of his friends and for himself and had them mailed to his home address.</p>

    <p>According to reports, 23-year-old Troy Callib Wallace began purchasing ecstasy via the dark web in early 2018. After ordering the drugs, he had them delivered to his home by mail. Over time, customs authorities grew suspicious of the packages shipped from abroad to his address. On April 17, Auckland customs authorities confiscated a package addressed to Wallace. On opening the package, the authorities found 0.4 grams of ecstasy. After several days, the authorities intercepted yet another package addressed to Wallace, the package carried 4.4 grams of ecstasy. Due to the discovery of drugs in the package, the customs authorities alerted the Napier police of Wallace’s drug importation activities.</p>
    <p>The seized drug packages proved probable cause for the Napier police to acquire a search warrant against Wallace’s residence. On the 18th of May, the Napier police raided and searched Wallace’s house. Their search resulted in the seizure of a phone on which Wallace had allegedly installed the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2019/01/18/research-analyzing-the-tor-routing-protocol-to-identify-structural-weaknesses/">TOR Browser</a>. From the phone, the police found conversations that showed Wallace had purchased the intercepted ecstasy. On being questioned, Wallace reportedly told the police that he had been ordering the drugs on behalf of his friends and for himself.</p>
    <p>After the arrest, the police attempted to intercept all drugs that Wallace had order by instructing <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/04/24/customs-seizures-of-illicit-darkweb-related-drugs-soar-in-new-zealand/">customs authorities to seize</a> any package addressed to Wallace’s residence. The plan worked, and the customs authorities in Napier Mail Centre intercepted a package sent to Wallace’s home. The intercepted package was contained 4.9 grams of ecstasy. The intercepted drugs formed the base for the case against Wallace, as he was charged with three counts of importing ecstasy.</p>
    <p>Wallace was presented before Judge Geoff Rea for his sentencing in the Napier District Court. Basing his decision on Wallace’s clean criminal record, Judge Rea sentenced Wallace to 8 months home detention that began on the 11th of February. Judge Rea instructed Wallace to refrain from consuming any drugs or alcohol. The judge also asked Wallace to go through any rehabilitation process recommended to him by his probation officer.</p>
    <p>Wallace’s sentence came shortly after New Zealand’s opposition’s spokesman, Mark Mitchell, condemned the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/11/10/high-court-judge-dismisses-all-charges-in-new-zealand-drug-importation-case/">government’s leniency towards those accused of ordering drugs through the darknet</a>. The spokesman gave an example of suspects caught in Operation Garden that focused on darknet drug importers. The spokesman claimed that none of those caught during the course of the investigation were prosecuted. Mitchel claimed that the suspects targeted in the operation imported LSD and MDMA through the darknet and should not have been left unprosecuted as it sent the wrong message.</p>
    <p>In defense of the government, the Assistant Commissioner Investigation’s Richard Chamber said that to reduce drug addictions and the effects of illicit drugs, approaches based on prevention, treatment and harm reduction should be involved as opposed to convictions alone. Chambers defended <a href="http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/operation-garden-%E2%80%93-prevention-focused-operation-targeting-dark-net-drug-imports">Operation Garden</a>, claiming it was prevention-based. He said that since most of those targeted acquired the drugs for personal use and not for resale, they were educated the on harmful effects of drugs and on harm reduction and would not be prosecuted. Chambers disclosed that the operation worked from information provided by Dutch authorities. The operation involved the police visiting 84 addresses in New Zealand believed to belong to importers of illicit drugs ordered via the dark web. As part of the action, all those visited by the police were issued with a formal warning.</p>
    <p>Chambers, however, warned that the prevention-based approach does not guarantee lack of prosecution when sufficient evidence is gathered. He also said that New Zealand police have a good relationship with customs authorities and international law enforcement authorities that have had success in the identification of dark web users. Chambers finally asked all those using or intending to use the darknet to conduct any illegal business to take a different path.</p>
