    <p>United States Secret Service agents were recently able to track down and bring down the most notorious domestic counterfeiter of Federal Reserve Notes, commonly referred to as US Dollars. The counterfeiter operated as a vendor on darknet markets under the name Billmaker. The Secret Service accuses 34 year old Daniel Johnson of Oklahoma of being the darknet counterfeit currency vendor known as Billmaker. For this investigation, agents from the Secret Service targeted large domestic vendors of counterfeit American currency who were operating on darknet markets. The Secret Service agents used comments and reviews that buyers left on vendors profile pages on the darknet markets. “We thought it would be too difficult to catch the ones operating in South America or overseas,” Secret Service Special Agent Glen M. Kessler of the Savannah, Georgia, Secret Service office <a href="https://www.postbulletin.com/life/lifestyles/catching-a-five-star-counterfeiter-on-the-dark-web/article_d1eb2354-2a29-11e9-8f5c-938f757e44d7.html">said</a> of the agency’s investigation into darknet currency counterfeiters.</p>
    <p>At the start of the nine month investigation, Secret Service Agent Matthew Britsch made his first purchase from Billmaker in September of 2017, having placed an order for four <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/counterfeit/">counterfeit</a> $100 bills, which he paid $120 in Bitcoin for. The fake bills arrived as expected and turned out to be as high quality as was advertised on the darknet market. The fake bills arrived in a red and blue envelope and were reproductions of the version of the $100 bill that has not been printed since 2013, as a newer and harder to counterfeit design of the $100 bill had begun to be printed. Billmaker’s counterfeit $100 bills had been printed on special paper using a high quality laser printer, and even included a security strip that was similar to authentic bills. Analysis of the four counterfeit $100 bills that the Secret Service received from Billmaker showed that they were linked to $4.1 million in counterfeit that had been passed. Because Billmaker offered a money back guarantee and provided free tracking on packages of counterfeit bills sent by the United States Postal Service. The tracking on the package of counterfeit bills that Billmaker had mailed to Secret Service Agent Matthew Britsch provided a significant clue to the law enforcement officers investigating the case. The tracking number had revealed that the package of fake bills had been mailed from the Oklahoma City area.</p>
    <p>Not long after the Secret Service began investigating Billmaker, the agency’s experts in Washington believed they were tracking Daniel Johnson of Oklahoma. Johnson had previously been convicted and served three years in prison for <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/piracy/">piracy</a> of intellectual property, as he had been caught bootlegging copies of Microsoft Office. In 2016, Johnson was arrested on counterfeiting charges, and in February of 2017 a federal grand jury had indicted him on charges of counterfeiting and cultivating marijuana. After Johnson was released on bond, he went on the run and disappeared. Johnson’s attorney M. Michael Arnett believed that Johnson would not be taken alive if law enforcement attempted to capture him, and after consulting authorities on legal ethics, Arnett passed on to law enforcement his belief that Johnson would violently resist being taken into custody again.</p>
    <p>In October of 2017, Secret Service agents tried to buy more counterfeit bills from Billmaker, but the darknet market Billmaker had been operating on was no longer in operation. Billmaker soon returned to being a vendor of counterfeit bills by selling on several new darknet markets. In January of last year, Secret Service agents were able to purchase four more fake $100 bills and did the same again in April of last year. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/uspis/">US Postal Service Inspectors</a> were able to determine that Billmaker had mailed his packages from blue mailboxes that were located across the street from the police department in Norman, Oklahoma. Law enforcement began to surveil the mailboxes and, after a few weeks, determined that Johnson was driving a black Ford pickup truck that was registered to a Florida man, whose identity had been stolen. The agents were then able to track down Johnson’s apartment. On May 17<sup>th</sup> of last year, as Johnson drove out of his driveway he was pursued by 10 cars containing agents from the Secret Service, the US Marshalls Service, and local police. Johnson exited his pickup truck with his AR-15 rifle and engaged in a shootout with law enforcement. Johnson was shot and killed by law enforcement before he had the chance to injure any of them. When law enforcement searched his Yukon home, they found $300,000 in counterfeit bills as well as encrypted computers which the agency is still unable to access.</p>
    <p>The United States Secret Service was formed in July of 1865, a time in which an estimated one third of all currency circulating in the United States was counterfeit. The Secret Service is now a branch of the United States Department of Homeland Security, it had previously been a division of the United States Department of Treasury until 2003. Currently, the Secret Service maintains that only a fraction of the currency circulating today is counterfeit. The United States Secret Service made an excess of 1,500 arrests last year, and seized over $204 million in counterfeit currency, with another $107 million seized by financial institutions and businesses in the last year.</p>
