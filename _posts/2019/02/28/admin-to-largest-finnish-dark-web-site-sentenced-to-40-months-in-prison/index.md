    <p>The admin to what was once the largest Finnish dark web marketplace was sentenced to 40 months in prison after a court found him guilty of facilitating drug trafficking through his site. The 45-year-old IT expert is believed to have been responsible for the creation and maintenance of the dark web site, Sipulikanava, from March 2014 to 2017. The site was designed to operate as a discussion forum with a market section that allowed its users to purchase and sell desired drugs.</p>

    <p>The 45-year-old and his accomplice, who was not prosecuted, were arrested on November 1, 2017, when <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/06/22/largest-dark-web-site-in-finland-closed-down-by-customs-on-drug-smuggling-allegations/">the site was officially taken down by a joint investigation</a> that involved the Finnish customs authorities and the National Bureau of Investigations. LE initiated investigations against the site and its admin in 2017 after they determined that a drugs vendor who operated as ‘Ekstaasikauppa’ had acquired some of his drugs through Sipulikanava. Ekstaasikauppa was arrested after an operation tied him to an online drug selling ring that carried out its operation using the alias <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/07/23/finlands-biggest-ex-vendor-sentenced-prison/">‘Douppingkauppa’ and was busted in 2016.</a></p>
    <p>From the investigation, the investigating authorities found out that the site had a discussion forum that offered legitimate goods and services. The admin of the site had created a market section where users of the site sold and purchased drugs. Initially, the admin allowed users to post ads describing their drug prices and quantities and their messaging ID’s. The buyers were also allowed to post ads portraying the amounts of drugs they wanted and their messaging ID’s as well. Later in 2016, the admin of the site modified the market section so that ads were based on locations, making it easier for sellers and buyers to complete transactions. It is through the site’s market section that Ekstaasikauppa responded to an ad offering to sell drugs and arranged for delivery of the purchased drugs through a messaging app used by the users of the site.</p>
    <p>Following evidence gathered in the course of the investigation, the customs authorities, the National Bureau of Investigations, and Helsinki Police Department’s Special Investigations Unit carried out a search on the admin’s home between October 31 and November 1, 2017. The search resulted in the seizure of a small quantity of drugs and technical evidence linked to the site’s operations. The police then searched the admin’s place of work where they allegedly seized a personal web server believed to be the backup server of Sipulikanava. The admin’s employer was reportedly unaware that Sipulikanava was being run under his was watch and was, as a result, not charged.</p>
    <p>Customs and the police disclosed that they had investigated 200 cases that involved the distribution of drugs via Sipulikanava in 2016 and 2017. The authorities believed that the site facilitated the sale and distribution of 12,000 ecstasy pills, over 10 kilograms of marijuana, over 400 grams of cocaine, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/mdma/">over 500 grams of MDMA</a>, over 20,000 Rivotril pills and over 200 grams of methamphetamine.</p>
    <p>The admin was, as a result charged, with aggravated drug offenses based on the fact that he created and moderated the market section of the site through which drug distribution transactions took place. The admin was also suspected of having acquired drugs for personal use through the site. The prosecutor’s office in Eastern Uusimaa disclosed that during the pre-trial investigations, the admin denied having been involved in the drug distribution activities but accepted being the creator and maintainer of Sipulikanava.</p>
    <p>District Prosecutor Anna-Riikka Ruth of the Attorney’s Office of Eastern Uusimaa disclosed that the Sipulikanava admin was the first admin of a dark web site to be charged in a court of law in Finland. She also said that the pre-trial investigation&#8217;s report was contained in 17,000 pages, leading to an eight day trial. The case was heard in the Eastern Uusimaa District Court.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the sentencing hearing, the prosecution recommended that the admin be sentenced to a minimum of 7 years in prison. The court, however, <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finnish_dark_web_drugs_site_admin_gets_40_months_in_jail/10641761">sentenced the admin to three years and four months in prison</a> and cited the fact that the admin only ran the site and was not directly involved in drug distribution activities carried out through the website as the basis for the issued sentence.</p>
