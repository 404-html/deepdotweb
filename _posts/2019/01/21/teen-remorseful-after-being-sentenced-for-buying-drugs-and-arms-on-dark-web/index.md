    <p>Noah C. Hendricks, 19, has expressed <a href="https://www.dailyitem.com/news/update-teen-remorseful-following-plea/article_05fbd6d8-0f73-11e9-818c-3781c3a6fbd3.html">how remorseful he is</a> after being sentenced to prison for dealing in dark web related drugs. He also supplied weapons which were used for a robbery. According to reports, the teenager has apologized for his wrongful behavior. &#8220;My actions were unwarranted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I apologize to the court and the community. It wasn&#8217;t called for,‚Äù he added.</p>
    <p>Hendricks was sentenced to 5 years to 10 years in prison. This sentence implies that the previous 289 days he spent in jail after his bail was revoked will be subtracted from his sentence. He pleaded guilty to nine felony counts, including robbery, conspiracy, and possession with the intent to distribute.</p>
    <p>An investigation was launched after his previous arrest revealed that the 19-year-old was the leader of a drug distribution network which involved eight adults and six juveniles. Hendricks possessed and sold marijuana in and outside the premises of Selinsgrove Area at Sophomore. He then advanced his trade by moving onto the deep web to obtain different kinds of drugs, using Philadelphia, New York, and State College, along with a few other locations for his orders. Through his activity, six non-fatal overdoses were recorded in Snyder County.</p>
    <p>According to information, Hendricks had in his possession a large amount mount of marijuana, Xanax pills, ecstasy, cocaine, a concentrated form of marijuana, psychedelic mushrooms, Percocet, and numerous sheets of dabs. In his previous hearing, he confessed that he once placed an order for 7,000 pills, however, 12,000 were delivered to him.</p>
    <p>As claimed by reports, Hendricks usually kept drugs and firearms in a backpack he carries. He gave free drugs to friends and sold a Percocet pill for $30 and marijuana for $20 per gram. He was said to have made a lot of money from this business. He accounted for his money by telling people he runs an internet jewelry business. One of the arrested juveniles testified to seeing a photo of cash totaling $100,000. Moreover, Hendricks bragged to his friends that he had $32,000 in cash from his business. Prior to his arrest, he disclosed to one of the also arrested juveniles that he had channeled his money into Bitcoin, and he owes a huge debt.</p>
    <p>In total, Hendricks was said to have sold 12,000 Xanax pills along with ecstasy, cocaine, Percocet, psychedelic mushrooms and marijuana. Also, Hendricks and his accomplices, Juvon Batts, Lamont Patterson, and Rasheed Hill, were accused of robbing the Susquehanna University. A few days later, they also robbed the Clarion College. Hendricks supplied the weapons for both robberies. Another four adults were charged with drug offenses. They were identified as Zach Broome, Jeffrey Dzierzawiec, Florin Nork, and Brendan Carner.</p>
    <p>Hendricks <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/09/13/pennsylvania-man-charged-with-distributing-12000-xanax-pills-and-other-drugs-from-the-darknet/%0a">was charged</a> with robbery, conspiracy, attempted robbery, dealing in profits of illegal activity and possession along with the intent to distribute. He was also charged with theft, simple assault, possession of firearms without having a license, and reckless endangerment of another person. For these charges, his bail was set for $2 million. He pleaded guilty to nine counts on Thursday.</p>
    <p>According to Senior Deputy Attorney General David Gorman, the sentence was appropriate. It is evident that Hendricks was penalized for engaging in the illicit distribution of drugs and firearms, it is also clear that the sentence was meant to send a strong message to the drug traffickers about the punishment that awaits them regardless of their age and status.</p>
    <p>Stephen Geday of North Wales, the defense attorney revealed at the law court that Hendricks is very remorseful. According to him, Hendricks is not only sorry for what he has done but also for the impact of his actions on his family. As the son of a member of Selinsgrove Borough Council, Shane Hendricks, the extent of damage his actions caused the family was evident as none of his family members were present at the court on Thursday.</p>
    <p>After his release from prison, Hendricks will serve five years on probation under state supervision. If he in any way violates the condition for his probation, he will possibly face 10 to 20 years in jail.</p>
    <p>His arrest is similar to the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/09/21/teenager-sentenced-to-community-service-for-ecstasy-importation/%0a">arrest of a teenager</a> who led a drug trafficking organization and was sentenced to community service. The popularity of dark web among the youth, especially college students, has left authorities with no option but to confront them with the full force of the law.</p>
