    <p>Virtual Private Network (or VPN) service provides online security and anonymity to millions of users around the world. It encrypts your data and creates a tunnel around it to prevent IP address leakage. It also allows its users to bypass georestriction and access websites and content they usually cannot from their location.</p>
    <p>By design, VPN software connects you to the server and assigns you with a different IP address which you share with other people connected to the same server.</p>
    <p>One of the most improved and most popular VPN services is CyberGhost.</p>
    <p><a href="https://cybershield.cc/deepdogen_4vgxlcga4.html?aff_sub=ddwrev"><img class="wp-image-28095" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-11.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-11.png 1583w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-11-300x131.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-11-1024x448.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1583px) 100vw, 1583px" /></a></p>

    <p>This VPN service provider was founded back in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania. The company currently employs 45 IT professionals who work hard to provide the service to over 20 million users worldwide. Part of the team is located in Germany, and its members are mostly in charge of software development. The leader of the company is one of the co-founders, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robert-knapp-2">Robert Knapp</a>.</p>
    <p>CyberGhost is a proud advocate for internet security, freedom and civil rights.</p>
    <p>CyberGhost’s user interface is well-designed and straightforward. The app is modern with predominately black and yellow features.</p>
    <p>If you want to install the app for Windows OS, you will have to <a href="https://cybershield.cc/deepdogen_4vgxlcga4.html?aff_sub=ddwrev">go to the company’s website</a> and click on the <em>Apps</em> section.</p>
    <p><a href="https://cybershield.cc/deepdogen_4vgxlcga4.html?aff_sub=ddwrev"><img class="wp-image-28096" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-12.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-12.png 1295w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-12-300x111.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-12-1024x378.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1295px) 100vw, 1295px" /></a></p>
    <p>Then, select Windows and hit the <em>Download</em> button.</p>
    <p>You will have to choose a subscription plan and payment method. When these steps are completed, your app will be ready to download.</p>
    <p><a href="https://cybershield.cc/deepdogen_4vgxlcga4.html?aff_sub=ddwrev"><img class="wp-image-28097" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-13.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-13.png 1251w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-13-300x97.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-13-1024x332.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1251px) 100vw, 1251px" /></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://cybershield.cc/deepdogen_4vgxlcga4.html?aff_sub=ddwrev"><strong>&gt;&gt; Get the Special $2.75 per month VPN deal here.</strong></a></p>
    <p>Once the installation is completed and you have entered the credentials, your CyberGhost app will be ready to use. <em>(Note: For the purposes of this demonstration, we will be using the Windows application.)</em></p>
    <p>If you want to install software for your iOS device, you will have to go to official CyberGhost VPN site <a href="https://cybershield.cc/deepdogen_4vgxlcga4.html?aff_sub=ddwrev">here</a>, and purchase a plan, then you can go to the AppStore and download the app.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28098" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-11.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-11.jpeg 750w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-11-249x300.jpeg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
    <p>Once the download is completed, allow VPN access, enable notifications, enter your credentials, and you will be good to go. If you do not have an account, you will have to purchase a subscription plan first.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28099" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-12.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-12.jpeg 574w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-12-179x300.jpeg 179w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28100" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-13.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-13.jpeg 572w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-13-179x300.jpeg 179w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28101" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-14.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-14.jpeg 576w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-14-180x300.jpeg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
    <p>At the central part of the homepage, you can find an <em>on and off </em>button.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28102" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-15.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-15.jpeg 558w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-15-174x300.jpeg 174w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></p>
    <p>You can connect to the suggested server, or chose another one from a drop-down menu.</p>
    <p>At the top left corner, there is the <em>Options</em> button that includes <em>Settings, FAQs </em>and<em> Feedback</em>. Here you can also upgrade your subscription plan.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28103" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-16.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-16.jpeg 566w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-16-177x300.jpeg 177w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
    <p>In the <em>Settings</em> section, users can enable Wi-Fi auto-protect option, manage Wi-Fi networks, make a list of secured connections, and choose what the app should do when connected to open networks.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28104" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-17.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-17.jpeg 558w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-17-174x300.jpeg 174w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></p>
    <p>After you have downloaded and installed the app, all you need to do is to connect to the network.</p>
    <p>To connect to a server, you have to turn on the button in the central part of the screen. You can connect to the suggested location, which is probably the nearest and the fastest.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28105" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-18.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-18.jpeg 558w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-18-174x300.jpeg 174w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></p>
    <p>However, if you want to use a website which is georestriced, open the drop-down menu and select one of the listed locations.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28106" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-19.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-19.jpeg 560w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-19-175x300.jpeg 175w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
    <p>If you want to use a VPN to watch Netflix or some other streaming service, you can opt for one of the servers which supports this option. They are located in a separate tab, which makes the entire process much easier. You can also create your own list of favorite servers.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28107" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-20.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-20.jpeg 562w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-20-176x300.jpeg 176w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" /></p>
    <p>CyberGhost utilizes the <em>OpenVPN </em>protocol, which is essentially the golden standard in VPN security, as well as <em>IKEv2</em> and <em>L2TP</em>. The software also uses double encryption, which means that besides VPN data, authentication data is also encrypted.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the app features the 256-bit encryption protocol.</p>
    <p><strong>Torrenting or P2P sharing </strong>is supported by CyberGhost, which is important for millions of torrenting enthusiasts. This hobby is still illegal in most countries and using VPN is a must if you want to stay protected and safe from the government’s lurking eyes. However, not all CyberGhost servers support this service. The ones that do are marked within the app.</p>
    <p><strong>Streaming </strong>is also supported for certain servers. Users can access broadcasting services and watch their favorite content without restrictions.</p>
    <p>CyberGhost provides protection while using public networks. This feature is essential for your online security and prevents your data from getting stolen.</p>
    <p>Also, the app has not shown any IP or DNS leaks.</p>
    <p>The company claims that they do not keep logs about their clients’ online activities. That means that even if the government orders CyberGhost to hand out the data regarding their users’ internet activity, they will have nothing to give.</p>
    <p>The fact the company is located in Romania is also a good news privacy-wise because this country is not a member of the “14 Eyes Alliance.” Countries who have signed this agreement are obliged to collect information about online traffic of their citizens, and share it among each other if required. For that reason, VPN companies located in countries that are not members of the alliance are always a smarter choice than the ones who are obliged to collect and share your data, even if they claim they do not keep logs.</p>
    <p>The apps are also compatible with the Tor browser and other proxies.</p>
    <p>According to CyberGhost’s official website, the speed is the “highest possible.” However, the truth is that the speed is not the company’s best trait, especially if you are using a free trial, which is available from time to time.</p>
    <p>What you can do to improve performance is to connect to the nearest server.</p>
    <p>Overall, CyberGhost is located in the middle of the list of VPN service providers when it comes to performance.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-28108" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-14.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-14.png 1153w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-14-300x49.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/word-image-14-1024x168.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1153px) 100vw, 1153px" /></p>
    <p>Some of the features CyberGhost offers within its apps include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>An ad blocker</strong> which prevents annoying popup windows from ruining your browsing experience. The software removes parts of the code that is pulling the ad from the server. This is nothing like a browser extension because the entire operation is taking place on the company’s servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Malware protection</strong> that keeps you safe from viruses and other malicious software. The app will verify the website URL and let you know if it hosts a virus or wants to steal your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Online traffic block </strong>which prevents websites from gaining insight into your online behavior that they can use later for customized ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Access to 3,000 servers worldwide </strong>located in more than 60 countries. Moreover, CyberGhost’s large network is constantly growing. The company has servers in Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Estonia, Iceland, Japan, Kenya, among other countries around the globe.</li>
    <li>The app is also equipped with an automatic <strong>kill switch</strong> that will terminate your internet connection if you somehow get disconnected from the server. That way, you will stay protected the entire time and your IP address will not leak.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One of the best features when it comes to customer support is live chat. On the website, you can contact the support team at any given moment.</p>
    <p>During the last year, CyberGhost has made several upgrades that have launched it to the top of the list of the most popular VPN services, including live chat and seven simultaneous connections. The service has not shown any leaks even while torrenting or using a streaming service. When it comes to speed, the service can be improved, but it is still enough for the app to work at an optimum level.</p>
    <p>Given the fact that the company’s headquarters are located in Romania and it has a strict no logs policy, CyberGhost is one of the most reliable VPN services currently on the market. The software is equipped with top-notch OpenVPN protocol and utilizes 256-bit encryption.</p>
    <p>There is an available version for Windows, Android, MacOS, iOS and routers. The user interface is simple, straightforward and easy to use.</p>
    <p>All of these factors contribute to the fact that CyberGhost offers reliable security to users and will provide a decent service even to professional users.</p>
