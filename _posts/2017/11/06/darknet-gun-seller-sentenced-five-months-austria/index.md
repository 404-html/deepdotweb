    <p>Towards the end of October, Spain’s Guardia Civil department arrested <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/10/20/guardia-civil-bust-former-alphabay-pistol-vendor/#comments">a former Alphabay firearm vendor</a>. With cooperation from Europol, international law enforcement agencies also arrested six of the vendor’s customers. The investigation led to the discovery that the 24-year-old vendor had shipped weapons to at least 30 customers in 11 countries. Several days after the announcement, a Salzburg judge convicted a 26-year-old vendor who had bought his guns and gun parts from a vendor in Spain.</p>
    <p>The prosecutor’s office in Salzburg charged the 26-year-old with weapons law violations for the alleged purchase and distribution of an AK-47 and at least five Glocks. According to the prosecution, the man had created a buyer account on an unidentified <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet/">darknet marketplace</a> as early as 2015. He “repeatedly” ordered both weapons and assorted parts from vendors in Spain and the United States. Judge Günther Nocker sentenced the man to five months in prison, taking into account weapons charges in other countries. <img class="wp-image-23413 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-image-6.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-image-6.png 759w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-image-6-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /></p>
    <p>Last year, for instance, a Bavarian court sentenced the man to two years imprisonment for both buying and selling illegal firearms. The man reportedly “had a weakness” for weapons. Judge Nocker issued the five month sentence as a supplementary sentence to the 2016 sentence in Bavaria.</p>
    <p>The defendant, <a href="https://www.pressreader.com/austria/salzburger-nachrichten/20171020/282187946256851">according to the prosecution</a>, shipped weapons to customers in Tyrol and to customers in the Netherlands. As with the vendor arrested in Spain, his customers will likely be identified (if they have not already been investigated). To catch buyers, the Spanish Guardia Civil worked with the German Customs Investigation Bureau; the Metropolitan Police; Homeland Security Investigators; Cyprus Police; and Europol. However, a package interception in the UK sparked the Spanish Guardia Civil’s investigation. They traced packages to and from the vendor and his customers.</p>
    <p>While the operation only netted six buyers, Europol likely became aware of many more; they reportedly knew of at least 30 customers. The vendor—on his Dream Market profile—claimed that they “were one of the most important weapon vendors on Alphabay Market.” They allegedly had completed 270 sales on Alphabay. On <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/dream-markets-alternative-links/">Dream Market</a>, the vendor account has been offline since October 6.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-23414 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-image-7.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-image-7.png 749w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-image-7-300x139.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-image-7-272x125.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
    <p>The 26-year-old with a “weakness for weapons” likely purchased the Kalashnikov from someone other than the vendor busted in the most recent international investigation, though. On the Alphabay and Dream vendor’s profile, they wrote, in response to a question regarding whether or not the vendor would sell AK-47s: “NO! NO! NO! I have rules, only self defense weapons.” If the cases were connected, the Glocks and illegally purchased fully functioning guns likely came from one the few firearm vendors. The Alphabay vendor who specifically sold Glocks went offline in late September.</p>
    <p>Since the sentencing in Salzburg, law enforcement arrested two more men for their involvement in the gun distribution network.</p>
