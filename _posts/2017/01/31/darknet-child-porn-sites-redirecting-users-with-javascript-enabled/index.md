    <p>Darknet and deepweb child pornography sites catch much of the darknet-related media coverage. And this is for good reason; law enforcement agencies worldwide made child pornography busts a priority in fighting darknet crime. Aside from that of the Silk Road, no other type of hidden service site garnered as much media attention as the FBI&#8217;s Operation Pacifier continually collected. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/12/20/playpen-member-fought-fbis-illegal-warrant-still-got-7-years-child-pornography/">Operation Pacifier suspects</a>, even now—years after the child pornography site &#8220;Playpen&#8221; faced infiltration by the FBI—stand trial. Additionally, the FBI sent information on suspects to countries across the globe, resulting in a growing number of large-scale busts.</p>

Many the latest user-identifying bugs found in Firefox—Tor&#8217;s big brother—relied on operator error or JavaScript-dependent malware. This is, in fact, the way the FBI managed to identify at least 214 Playpen members.</p>
    <p>The latest publicly-known bug existed in both Tor and Firefox. And by the bug, I mean vulnerability by which a threat actor pulled IP addresses from within Tor (Firefox) using a shellcode that strikingly resembled the shellcode used by the FBI during the PlayPen case. &#8220;When I first noticed the old shellcode was so similar, I had to double-check the dates to make sure I wasn&#8217;t looking at a 3-year-old post,” a security researcher tweeted.</p>
    <p>The JavaScript issue as reported on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-November/042639.html">the Tor mailing list</a>:</p>
    <p><em>“This is a Javascript exploit actively used against TorBrowser NOW. It consists of one HTML and one CSS file, both pasted below and also de-obscured. The exact functionality is unknown but it&#8217;s getting access to &#8220;VirtualAlloc&#8221; in &#8220;kernel32.dll&#8221; and goes from there. Please fix ASAP. I had to break the &#8220;the code&#8221; line in two in order to post, remove &#8216; + &#8216; in the middle to restore it.”</em></p>
    <p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a> reported:</p>
    <p><em>&#8220;The attack executed code when targets loaded malicious JavaScript and code based on scalable animation vector graphics. The exploit used the capability to send the target&#8217;s IP and MAC address to an attacker-controlled server. The code, in general, resembles the types of so-called network investigative techniques used by law-enforcement agencies and specifically one that the FBI used in 2013 to identify Tor-protected users who were trading child pornography.&#8221;</em></p>
    <p>Motherboard’s Joseph Cox wrote an article titled “<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/a-dark-web-child-porn-site-is-forcing-its-visitors-to-learn-security-tips">A Dark Web Child Porn Site Is Forcing Its Visitors to Learn Security Tips</a>.” While true, the concept and very feature of any given website requiring the disabling of JavaScript is not a new one. “At [child pornography site] we have always had a big JavaScript warning if you have it enabled If [child pornography site] ever stops warning about JavaScript, redirecting or blocking non-official &amp; outdated browsers, then you will know something is wrong.”</p>
    <p>No longer is the above child pornography site following the route of many hidden services by simply disallowing JavaScript; the site now <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html">redirects users to a page</a> on the Tails website on securely using Tor.</p>
