    <p>A 22-year-old man and his 27-year-old wife were <a href="https://www.tag24.de/nachrichten/polizei-durchsucht-drogen-wohnung-und-findet-mehr-als-erwartet-melle-buer-202976">arrested</a> in Melle, Germany for possessing of narcotics.</p>
    <p>The investigation started with an internet search, which led police to the 22-year-old’s home. Authorities suspected that the accused bought narcotics from a dark web vendor shop. On January 10, law enforcement authorities visited the man’s apartment. His wife opened the door and allowed officials in.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement authorities quickly found what they were looking for. However, they discovered more than they expected. Police found a small indoor plantation in an adjoining room to the bedroom. Officials seized 32 cannabis plants in total. 26 of them were already harvested by the suspects. Authorities found 508 grams of plant material, which could be processed later into marijuana, and the remains of the harvested crops.</p>

    <p>Police discovered additional amounts of narcotics in the living room. They seized 205 grams of magic mushrooms. Since authorities found three fresh mushroom cultures in the bathroom, they assumed that the man and his wife cultivated the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/drugs/">drugs</a> themselves.</p>
    <p>In addition to all the substances, law enforcement authorities seized 47 ecstasy pills, 1 gram of cocaine, 2.8 grams of tobacco-marijuana mixture and additional narcotics equipment.</p>
    <p>According to officials, the wife could expect a similar procedure as his husband. Both of them remained silent after their arrests. They seek legal advice for their defense.</p>
    <p>German authorities had a recent issue with counterfeit euros in the country. The German Federal Police Office announced that the fake bills circulated at an all-time high in 2016. The growing popularity of dark net markets could be listed among the reasons why there were so many counterfeit euros in the country (and in other countries too). According to the German news outlet BZberlin.de, the Brandenburg police <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/01/10/parts-germany-see-decline-counterfeit-use/">reported</a> that parts of Germany had seen a decline in the use of fake bills.</p>
    <p>The reason why the number of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/counterfeit/">counterfeit</a> euros in the region is decreasing, could be the bust of an international counterfeiting ring. The gang, called “<a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/12/17/darknet-bust-global-law-enforcement-raids-massive-counterfeiting-organization/">the Napoli Group</a>” used the dark net to sell the fake bills. Europol, with the help of local law enforcement authorities in multiple countries, busted the ring and released the names of the eight key operatives. Among them was Carmine Guerriero, who controlled the dark web vendor accounts while his mother, sisters, and cousin conducted other parts of the business.</p>
    <p>According to a source, at one point, the NapoliGroup produced 90 percent of the counterfeit euros in circulation. However, after the gang’s bust, the number dropped significantly. This could confirm the Brandenburg police’s report. The Department announced that investigators seized 793 counterfeit bills in the first half of 2015. However, in the first half of 2016, authorities confiscated only 610 fake euros – 30 percent less than in 2015. The number of counterfeit 20 euro bills had seen a decrease too. The Brandenburg police collected 430 fake notes in 2015, while they seized 131 in 2016 during the same period.</p>
