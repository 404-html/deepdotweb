    <p>One May 30, French police <a href="http://www.breizh-info.com/2017/06/02/70974/pays-de-retz-trois-jeunes-majeurs-faisaient-pousser-cannabis-revendaient-a-saint-hilaire-de-chaleons">arrested</a> three men in Saint-Hilaire de Chaléons, France, who allegedly cultivated cannabis, which they resold to their customers.</p>

    <p>The police disclosed that three market gardeners, 18, 20, and 22 years old were all running a narcotic operations, where they grew cannabis at a greenhouse, produced the substance, and resold them to customers. Since there is only a minimal information in the case, we do not know if the suspects used “traditional” ways (selling the drug locally, on the streets) or the dark web to sell the marijuana to their customers.</p>
    <p>However, their business did not last long. Law enforcement authorities on May 30 raided the location where the defendants cultivated the marijuana, and arrested the young suspects. According to the police, the main suspect admitted that he sold approximately 13 kilograms of the substance. Investigators said that the criminal operation started in September 2016. During the police raid, law enforcement authorities seized about 10 kilograms of marijuana and a shotgun. The trial will be held in Saint-Nazaire on October 3.</p>
    <p>At the end of May, law enforcement authorities <a href="http://www.20minutes.fr/nantes/2075583-20170527-nantes-tranquille-drogue-amour-livree-domicile">arrested</a> a young man from Nantes, France for ordering <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/03/12/french-students-arrested-sale-10000-ecstasy-pills/">ecstasy</a> pills from the Netherlands. According to the French news outlet 20minutes.fr, a young man in his twenties was detained on May 26 after customs intercepted a package containing ecstasy pills arriving from the Netherlands. The prosecution considers charging the suspect with the importation of narcotics.</p>

    <p>The media outlet stated that the illicit substances were delivered to the home of the suspect in Nantes. The defendant allegedly used the dark web and purchased the drugs from a vendor residing in the Netherlands. The man was placed in police custody.</p>
    <p>On May 18, the court <a href="http://www.ouest-france.fr/bretagne/pledran-22960/pledran-il-se-faisait-livrer-de-la-drogue-par-colis-postal-5003015">sentenced</a> a Frenchman from Plédran, France for ordering large amounts of narcotics from the internet. It is not stated in the court documents, however, there is a big chance that the defendant purchased the drugs from the dark web.</p>
    <p>According to the court documents, the defendant ordered 17 grams of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/18/250g-amphetamine-buyer-to-see-a-judge-in-april/">amphetamine</a> from the internet to a postal office near Rennes. However, on January 13, at the customs office, sniffer dogs identified the package, which contained the drugs. Law enforcement authorities followed the package and performed a controlled delivery at the suspect.</p>
    <p>Investigators delivered the narcotics to the man, and when the defendant opened the package, they immediately arrested him. Soon after the suspect was placed in police custody, he admitted that he ordered amphetamines from the internet for his own use. When law enforcement authorities searched the home of the defendant, they found 639 grams of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/17/four-admit-guilt-marijuana-conspiracy/">marijuana</a> and 20 cannabis plants, which the suspect allegedly cultivated for his own use.</p>
    <p>The defendant, who is a family man, admitted that he has been a consumer of cannabis for several years. However, when the police asked him about the amphetamine, he answered that he needed the substance to cure his sleep problems. According to the court documents, the man diagnosed himself as “hypersomnia, which is a neurological disorder of excessive time spent sleeping or excessive sleepiness. The defendant’s lawyer claimed that the man refused to take antidepressants or any other legal medication for his sleeping disorder, that’s why he purchased amphetamine from the internet.</p>
    <p>When the defendant was asked about the 20 <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/cannabis/">cannabis</a> plants, his lawyer claimed that those were exclusively for the man’s own use. The attorney argued that since officers did not find anything on his client’s phone, there is no evidence that he resold or intended to resell the drugs to others.</p>
    <p>A representative of the customs office recommended the court to fine the man for 2,826 euros, “which is the value of what has been seized&#8221;. In addition, the prosecution requested a 6-month prison sentence along with a suspended sentence.</p>
    <p>The criminal court sentenced the defendant to one year of suspended prison sentence, and he has to pay 2,826 euros to the customs office.</p>
