    <p>Being a DeepDotWeb user, you know that keeping your information secure is important. Although message encryption, like any other technology, can be used for less than noble purposes, the benefits it brings to ordinary users and companies outweigh the damage by far. This is why users, from tech-savvy to average, are always looking for better ways to secure their conversations.</p>
    <p>Some services do provide a certain level of privacy, but their centralized business structure still brings multiple drawbacks that can endanger your security, usually through “Man In The Middle” attacks, where the access to encrypted messages or the ability to authenticate them falsely is granted.</p>
    <p>In order to fix the lack of security and efficiency found in today’s message encryption solutions, <a href="https://ico.crypviser.net/">Crypviser </a>is tapping into the properties of blockchain technology to build <em>“the first encrypted network for social and business communication based on Blockchain”.</em></p>
    <p>By leveraging the distributed and transparent nature of the blockchain (and the immutability provided by its miners), Crypviser is able to build an authentication model that allows users to truly identify themselves and confirm each other&#8217;s identity through public keys, removing third parties from the equation and eliminating “Man in the Middle” threats that are found in centralized systems.</p>
    <p>In this case, the blockchain itself acts as a decentralized database that connects user accounts to public keys, ensuring that only the owners of the private keys can decrypt messages and that no fake messages can be sent. In order to interact with this system, the user will need the CVCoin, the underlying value token in the Crypviser network.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of the CVCoin is to pay transaction fees required to authorize and identify the user public encryption keys. The CVCoin will also be used for in-chat money transfers through the CVPay feature.</p>
    <p>Not only will Crypviser provide a secure network where individuals and companies can communicate with each other, it will also extend its services to the outside world through the use of “OpenWorld technology”, which grants the ability of secure communication with the external world. Users can access additional features and tools:</p>
    <p>Features include International Virtual DID numbers, cost-effective wholesale minute packages for international calls, international calls via VoIP, distribution programs, and more. These services will be available on the system-integrated online store and can be managed through the user&#8217;s Web Account.</p>
    <p>In order to fund the development and marketing of Crypviser’s network, the project is currently hosting an <a href="https://ico.crypviser.net/">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>, during which the CVCoin can be acquired. So far, the Crypviser ICO has managed to gather roughly $1,350 million. The ICO will last until the end of June.</p>
    <p>In the future, Crypviser plans to launch the new stage of the project, Crypviser 2.0, which will be based on the new kind of Blockchain especially designed for the reliable encryption keys exchange and authentication purposes, allowing it to be light enough so that every device can operate as a node.</p>
