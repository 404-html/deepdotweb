    <p>Earlier on this week, a 29-year-old man from Dachau, Germany, who is considered as the main suspect in the case, was <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/dachau/prozess-vor-dem-landgericht-muenchen-ii-drogenumschlagplatz-in-dachau-1.3518836#redirectedFromLandingpage">standing trial</a> for illegal drug trafficking. The investigation revealed that a residential community in Dachau was apparently acting as a central transshipment station for various kinds of drugs over a longer period of time.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old was standing before the 2nd Court in Münich on May 23. According to the testimony of the defendant, cocaine, amphetamine, ecstasy, and considerable amounts of marijuana and hashish were regularly passed through the housing community in Dachau. In the cellar, which belongs to the apartment, law enforcement authorities found more than 2.2 kilograms of hash and marijuana. After the 29-year-old’s arrest in April 2016, during the police interrogation, the accused provided a list of names to the investigators containing persons who were allegedly involved in the illegal drug business. According to the court documents, the police are currently investigating those suspects.</p>
    <p>The defendant himself was one of the “permanent guests” in the housing community, court documents stated. The 29-year-old played the main role in the illicit narcotic trade, which was operated from his home. On May 23, the 29-year-old was charged with the “deliberate” trafficking of illegal drugs in significant quantities. For 13 months, the defendant was held at the Stadelheim Prison.</p>
    <p>The accused admitted before the court that he ordered various kinds of narcotic drugs multiple times from the dark web, which were delivered to the residential community using the national postal service. The now closed <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/12/shiny-flakes-bust-38-houses-raided/">&#8220;Shiny Flakes&#8221; vendor shop</a>, on which he did his shopping, has already acquired a certain fame since it was operated by a 20-year-old man from Leipzig, who had amassed a surprisingly large amount of drugs when he was caught. The young man had sold almost a ton of drugs (914 kilograms, according to the police records) and made an estimated turnover of four million euros. In November 2015, the District Court of Leipzig <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/07/shiny-flakes-sentenced-to-7-years/">sentenced</a> him to seven years of juvenile punishment. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/05/12/past-customer-shiny-flakes-sentenced-probation/">Many of his customers</a> have been or are being brought to justice by law enforcement authorities. The 29-year-old suspect in the current case is one of them.</p>
    <p><a id="post-20536-_gjdgxs"></a> According to the court documents, the 29-year-old ordered a total of five times from the Shiny Flakes vendor shop between November 2014 and February 2015. After the transactions were completed, the dealer residing in Leipzig sent the 29-year-old more than 250 grams of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/amphetamine/">amphetamine</a>, 125 ecstasy pills, 18 grams of cocaine, and 25 grams of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/05/03/mdma-buyer-confessed-ordering-804-grams/">MDMA</a> to the mailboxes of the defendant’s acquaintances, to whom, in return, he distributed small gifts and gave concessions from the drugs. However, court documents stated that the defendant wanted to keep a considerable share of the drugs for himself. In court, he emphasized that he has a problem of addiction and he seeks to do a stationary therapy.</p>
    <p>The prosecutor&#8217;s office in Münich also accused the man of distributing the 2.2 kilograms of hashish and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/12/wa-state-bill-ban-bitcoin-marijuana-shops-dies-companies-bring-bitcoin-marijuana-stores/">marijuana</a>, which were found in the cellar by the police. According to one of the accomplices of the 29-year-old, the main suspect sold the drugs to a dealer called &#8220;Der Tscheche&#8221; (meaning “The Czech”) for more than 20,000 euros. According to the court documents, the 29-year-old admitted that he had a key for the house and had free access to the drugs. The defendant allegedly purchased about 300 grams of the drugs for himself, however, he resold the other part of the narcotics to a third party.</p>
    <p>The judge, Oliver Ottmann, listened to several persons from Dachau as witnesses, including a 20-year-old man, who had provided information on the 29-year-old after being caught with small amounts of drugs by the police. In court, however, he hesitated to talk. At the request of the judge, he confirmed that he was afraid of the main defendant. Only a few weeks ago, he had been allegedly harassed by a man from the accused&#8217;s surroundings, saying that &#8220;we still have an account open.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;The great silence has broken out in Dachau,&#8221; the judge said after hearing that other witnesses provided information to the police, but they refused to testify at the court. A verdict in the case will be announced on June 27.</p>
