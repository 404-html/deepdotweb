    <p>Law enforcement authorities <a href="http://www.idowa.de/inhalt.deggendorf-19-jaehriger-bestellte-drogen-ueber-das-darknet.741d79d9-042d-448e-bd3e-5e83cfc51feb.html">detained</a> a young man from Deggendorf, Germany for ordering bulk quantities of amphetamine from the dark web.</p>

    <p>According to the police information, the Deggendorf police arrested a 19-year-old man for using the dark web to order narcotics. The investigators stated that the man allegedly purchased 50 grams of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/amphetamine/">amphetamine</a>, along with small amounts of other drugs. Since 50 grams is considered as a significant amount of amphetamine, law enforcement authorities suspect that the 19-year-old may have resold or intended to resell the substance to local customers. Since the arrest happened recently, the police are currently investigating illegal drug trafficking.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, law enforcement authorities did not provide more information in the case, including how they tracked down the suspect. Since there were multiple vendor arrests in the recent years in Germany where investigators found information on the customers of the drug sellers, there could be a chance that police used such info to identify the 19-year-old defendant. The most recent investigations on a dark net vendor’s customers in Germany was announced in March, saying that the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Koblenz <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/03/22/1000-investigations-started-customers-narcotics-vendor-chemical-love/">started more than 1,000 investigations</a> against past customers of the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/17/dark-web-vendor-chemical-love-busted-50-kg-drugs-seized/">Chemical Love</a> vendor shop.</p>
    <p>On May 31 evening, the SEK (Special Deployment Commando) was tasked to <a href="http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/lokales/aachen/zwei-sek-einsaetze-in-brand-drogen-ueber-darknet-verkauft-1.1637487">perform two raids</a> in Aachen, Germany. The first assignment took place on the corner street at about 5:00 pm, however, shortly after 7 pm, there was another police operation in Buschstraße. According to the prosecutor’s office in Aachen, both missions were related to drug-criminality. In the law enforcement operation, the SEK units detained six persons.</p>

    <p>The men who were arrested were three German nationals at the age of 23, 29 and 34 years. The 23-year-old was arrested at his home in Buschstraße. According to the prosecutor&#8217;s office, they had a warrant for the arrest stating that the suspects violated the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/05/04/german-fined-for-ordering-narcotics-for-a-friend/">Narcotics</a> Act. In addition, three other men were arrested who are being investigated by the police. In one of the arrests, investigators already released one suspect.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Later it was reported that two arrest warrants were issued. There seems to be no suspicion against the third person, he was released several hours later,” the prosecutor’s office stated.</p>
    <p>The 23, 29, and the 34-year-old suspect is accused of selling <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/drugs/">drugs</a> on the dark web. According to the prosecution, all payments were conducted in <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoins</a>.</p>
    <p>The investigation started when Europol provided details on the suspects, which the European agency acquired from seized dark net marketplaces in November 2014. The investigations were first conducted by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), however, later on, it was handed to the Aachen Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. It is assumed that since the autumn of 2015, the defendants alone sent at least 20 kilograms of amphetamine, with the total price of at least 160,000 euros, to their customers using the national postal service. However, where the criminals kept the profits of their drug operation, is still the subject of the investigation.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement authorities secured evidence from the suspects, including computers and amphetamine in the kilogram range. There is also a witness in the case, who will be questioned by the police later.</p>
    <p>According to the German news publication <a href="http://blog.zeit.de/stoerungsmelder/2017/06/02/sek-einsatz-in-aachen-neonazis-als-drogendealer-verhaftet_23863">Zeit Online</a>, the suspects were allegedly members of a militant neo-Nazi group called “Kameradschaft Aachener Land” (KAL). The comradeship was banned in 2012 by Ralf Jäger, the interior minister of North-Rhine Westphalia, for &#8220;aggressively combative attitude &#8230; against elementary principles of the constitution&#8221;. Zeit Online claimed that the 34-year-old suspect is a “well-known” neo-Nazi. However, this information was not confirmed by the prosecutor’s office in Aachen.</p>
    <p>The news outlet also claimed that the arrest exploded the social network, where some members of the German neo-Nazi movement stated that the police action was a conspiracy between the police and the judiciary, while others were “cursing their comrades for doing drugs”.</p>
    <p>&#8220;It is quite clear that drugs have no place in our ranks&#8221;, neo-Nazi activist, Sven Skoda, wrote after the arrests. However, Zeit Online claimed that Skoda referred to some of the arrested suspects as &#8220;comrades, who have always stood with our courage and blood in their hearts, even in troubled times to our idea”.</p>
