    <p>Law enforcement authorities <a href="http://ziaruldeiasi.ro/stiri/traficanti-de-cannabis-ecstasy-si-amfetamina-arestati-preventiv-la-ia-i--160506.html">arrested</a> two men in Iasi, Romania for trafficking in narcotics. Police claimed that one of the suspects ordered the illicit substances from the dark web, while the other bought them from him with the intention to resell the drugs.</p>

    <p>A press release of the Romanian law enforcement authorities revealed that on May 20, 2017 the Iasi Territorial Service of the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) ordered the detention of two defendants, Andrei Dragoş Spiratos and Tudor Constantin Ernilă, for a period of 24 hours for the crimes of drug trafficking and importing narcotics to Romania.</p>
    <p>There is reasonable suspicion in the case that during the year of 2017 Ernilă sold narcotics to Spiratos, including “moderate-risk and high-risk substances”. According to the police information, the suspect sold cannabis, ecstasy, and amphetamine to Spiratos. Law enforcement authorities suspect that the buyer purchased the narcotics from the co-defendant to resell them to local customers in the area of Iasi.</p>
    <p>According to the police information, it was revealed during the course of the investigation that Ernilă used the dark web to order the narcotics. Since law enforcement authorities seized large amounts of drugs in the defendant’s home, there is a high chance that the man purchased the substances in bulk from sellers residing on dark net marketplaces or forums.</p>
    <p>On May 19, 2017, investigators were already on the trail of Ernilă. According to the police, as the defendant was walking to a local post office in Iasi to pick up a package of “high risk” narcotics arriving from the Netherlands, law enforcement authorities detained the suspect.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the Iasi Territorial Service of the DIICOT along with criminal police officers of the Brigade of Organized Crime of Iasi conducted eight house searches in the municipality of Iasi, during which they were able to seize 110 <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/24/three-arrested-netherlands-selling-ecstasy-darknet/">ecstasy</a> pills, multiple <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/17/four-admit-guilt-marijuana-conspiracy/">marijuana</a> plantations along with 13 grinders and three electronic precision scales.</p>
    <p>On May 21, the Iasi Court ordered the further detention of both defendants for the period of 30 days.</p>
    <p>In the law enforcement action, specialized support was provided by the Special Operations Division.</p>
    <p>In the press release, law enforcement authorities emphasized the importance that the rights of the defendants are being kept.</p>
    <p>“We mention that, throughout the trial, suspects and defendants have the rights and procedural guarantees of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the presumption of innocence,” the press release goes by.</p>
    <p>According to the Romanian news outlet ziaruldeiasi.ro, Ernilă and Spiratos are among the first defendants who were arrested in connection with darknet <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/drugs/">drug</a> trafficking. The media outlet is right, there were only a few dark web-related cases in Romania, and not all were connected to narcotics. The most recent one happened in February when the DIICOT <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/02/19/online-network-drug-traffickers-busted-romania/">carried out</a> 68 house searches and arrested 58 defendants who are suspected of being part of a major narcotics distribution ring in the country. The investigation started at the end of 2015, it revealed that the gang was ordering drugs from the Netherlands and cultivated cannabis, and either sold or resold the substances to local customers.</p>
