    <p>On Thursday, September 29, 2016, a police officer was arrested in Bereldingen, Luxemburg for the suspicion of poisoning the food of two people found dead. Law enforcement authorities are <a href="http://www.wort.lu/de/lokales/mutmasslicher-giftmord-polizist-weiter-in-u-haft-58f9f383a5e74263e13adc53">still investigating the case</a> of the potential double homicide, where, according to police information, there is a dark web connection.</p>

    <p>On September 25, 2016, a couple, a 29-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man, were hiking in Vianden, Luxemburg in the morning. After the hike, they visited the woman’s brother, the 27-year-old police officer who is currently suspected of murder, in his apartment in Bereldingen. After the couple had taken food at the 27-year-old’s apartment, they had complained of severe nausea and passed out. After the ambulance arrived, the emergency doctor could only call the death of the two victims.</p>
    <p>A witness told local media outlet Luxemburger Wort how he happened to hear a conversation between the suspect and two of his colleagues at the next table in a restaurant. The police officer, who was under suspicion at the time, made an impression and expressed his fear of &#8220;getting problems&#8221; to his colleagues. The reason for his fear was that he found &#8220;an ampoule with a liquid&#8221; on the balcony of his apartment. He had thrown them out, thinking that it contained maggots inside. His two colleagues urged him to report the incident to the investigators. However, since he had hesitated to do so, one of the other two men finally made the call.</p>
    <p>The fact that the two victims died at the same time at the same place after they took food at the suspect’s apartment, along with the autopsy report that confirmed the poisoning, implies the strong suggestion of murder. However, the results of the autopsy report are yet to be made public. We do not know the exact toxin that was found in the bodies of the victims.</p>
    <p>Three days after the death of the two victims, investigators searched the apartment of the suspect, looking for the container. A month after the first search, law enforcement authorities searched the suspect’s home again, but they couldn’t find the container. Police suspect that the container could be used to store the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/toxin/">toxins</a> that could be used in the murder. According to the Luxemburger Wort, there could be a chance that the 27-year-old, if he really is a murderer, could have killed his mother. The mother of the suspect died in 2014 in the same apartment, more precisely in the bathtub. At that time, however, a natural death had been diagnosed. It was not possible to investigate the corpse, which was a matter of investigation. The woman was cremated.</p>
    <p><a id="post-19698-_gjdgxs"></a> According to the LW, there is evidence in the case that the suspect ordered the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/poison/">poison</a> from the dark web. The news outlet stated that such offers on dark net marketplaces are actually known. In 2015, a 20-year-old US citizen was arrested, who sold substances, including <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/23/ricin-vendor-found-not-guilty-darknet-distribution-seeking-acquittal-theft-charges/">Ricin</a> and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/04/08/manchester-teenager-admits-trying-to-buy-deadly-toxin-from-dark-net/">Abrin</a>, on &#8220;Black Market Reloaded&#8221;. Both substances are among the most dangerous toxins known. What poison is actually present in the current case is still unclear. Furthermore, poisoning with cyanide is possible.</p>
    <p>In the case of cyanide, also known as potassium cyanide, it is the potassium salt of the blue acid, which is one of the most dangerous and the fastest acting poisons. The lethal dose of cyanide for an adult human is about 140 milligrams, which corresponds to a knife tip of the bitter-tasting and well-water-soluble salt. When swallowed, the substance is converted into lethal blue acid in contact with the gastric acid. This blocks the cell respiration in the body and leads to an internal asphyxiation death, which occurs depending on dosage after several minutes or up to one hour. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, dizziness, vomiting, cramps, and finally impotence after a few seconds or minutes. In the case of the victim, the skin is also characterized by a bright reddening of the skin, bleeding of the mucous membranes as well as a perceptible bitter-tingling odor resulting from the release of the poison in the stomach.</p>
