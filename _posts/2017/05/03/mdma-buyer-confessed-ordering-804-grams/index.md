    <p>A Special Agent with the Department of Homeland Security successfully Investigated and arrested a self-admitted ecstasy buyer. According to the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/345657519/Eric-Josue-Carazo-complaint">Criminal Complaint</a>, the defendant, Eric Josue Carazo, ordered a total of 804 grams of MDMA from a German darknet vendor. The investigation into the Austin, Texas based man started after a K-9 unit alerted US Customs of a package that contained a “rock-like substance.”</p>
    <p>On April 1, 2017, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, along with a Spike, a six-year-old K-9 unit, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/customs/">examined packages at the JFK airport in New York</a>. Spike pointed officers in the direction of a package from Germany, addressed to a David Garcia at a PO box in Austin, Texas. The officers conducted a field test on the packages contents: 258 grams of a “tan rock-like substance.” It tested positive for MDMA.</p>
    <p>The CBP officers alerted law enforcement in Texas where <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/usps/">the Post Office accepted the package</a>. They prepared for a controlled delivery. Special Agent Jacinto received the package and turned it over to the Austin Police Department. The United States Postal Inspection Service agent on the case, Carl King, checked the recipient&#8217;s PO box. He found another package from the same address in Germany, also addressed to David Garcia. The USPIS agent handed the package over to the Austin Police Department.</p>
    <p>On April 10, Homeland Security Investigations, USPIS, and <a href="http://www.kvue.com/mb/news/crime/0418-mdma-possession-charge-eric-carazo/432209254">the Austin Police Department</a> prepared for David Garcia at the Post Office. However, Eric Carazo arrived at the scene. He signed for the packages and the officers subsequently arrested him. After the arresting officers read Carazo his Miranda Rights, they carried him to the Police Department. The question began and Carazo admitted that the packages belonged to him.</p>

    <p>He told the officers that he ordered the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/mdma/">MDMA from a darknet supplier</a> for $1,500. Additionally,a PO box in Buda held another package of the substance, he told the questioning officers and HSI agent. Officers found that the package was actually at the man&#8217;s house, and Carazo gave them permission to enter. The third package, found at his house, also contained MDMA but was addressed to a Lucas Perez.</p>
    <p>“While executing a search warrant from APD,” the HSI agent wrote in the Criminal Complaint,”two identification cards were found with Carazo&#8217;s picture.” They found one North Carolina ID with the name David Daniel Garcia and one Maryland ID with Lucas Perez as the name. He explained that he purchased the IDs for the PO Box registration.</p>
    <p>Authorities charged Carazo with “knowingly and intentionally possessing with the intent to distribute approximately 804 grams of Methylenedioxy-Methamphetamine (MDMA), a Schedule I controlled substance.”</p>
