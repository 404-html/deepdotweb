    <p>On March 21, investigators <a href="http://www.bild.de/regional/berlin/kindesmissbrauch/mann-lockte-maedchen-im-netz-und-missbrauchte-sie-50996682.bild.html">detained</a> a man from Berlin, Germany who is suspected of luring underaged girls and sharing the media content of their abuse on the dark web.</p>

    <p>According to police information, the 36-year-old man allegedly abused girls between the age of 9 and 14. The suspect misled the victims with fake profiles on social networks, the local police and the prosecutor announced it on Friday. Officials added that the 36-year-old disguised as a 13-year-old girl on social networks to win the trust of his victims. Police claimed that the suspect shared the child pornographic content with other pedophiles on the dark web.</p>
    <p>Officials reported that the 36-year-old only use public internet access for his criminal activities, which made the investigation more difficult. However, with covert investigation methods and technical help, the investigators managed to identify the suspect, issue an arrest warrant, and detained him on Tuesday. Law enforcement authorities searched both the home of the man and his potential victims, where officers reported that they found extensive evidence. Investigators conducted house searches in many locations both in Austria and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/germany/">Germany</a>.</p>
    <p>Earlier this month, a 59-year-old man from Toronto, Canada was <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3308759/toronto-man-arrested-for-allegedly-distributing-child-porn-online/">arrested</a> for possessing and distributing child pornography material on the internet, possibly on the dark web. On March 13, investigators from the Toronto Police Sex Crimes Child Exploitation Section executed a search warrant at an address near Kingston Road and Warden Avenue in Scarborough, where they arrested the 59-year-old Gregory William Dennis. According to the investigators, the suspect had accessed, possessed and distributed <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/02/25/maryland-man-guilty-darknet-child-porn-accusations/">child porn</a> material under the username of “Williegeedee”. Police did not disclose whether the man committed the alleged crimes on the clearnet (the normal part of the internet) or on the dark web, however, since he used a username to upload and share the material, the 59-year-old possibly did that on a dark net child pornography forum.</p>
    <p>Dennis is charged with two counts of possession of child pornography, access to child pornography and distribution of child pornography. As of March 14, the accused was listed on Humber College’s website as a part-time faculty member in the School of Media Studies and Information Technology. The investigation in the case is still going, updates could be expected in the future.</p>
    <p>Just like in Canada and Germany, recently, US law enforcement authorities <a href="http://katu.com/news/local/corvallis-man-accused-of-illegal-distribution-of-child-porn-online">arrested</a> a suspect for child porn related crimes. Benton County Sheriff&#8217;s deputies executed a search warrant at a home on SW 7th Street in Corvallis on March 21. They detained the 23-year-old Pin-Han Tsai, who is facing 10 counts of encouraging child sex abuse in the first degree and two counts of encouraging child sex abuse in the second degree. The arrest warrant was a part of an investigation into illegal distribution of child porn material online (possibly <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/04/14/arrests-playpen-case/">PlayPen</a> related). Law enforcement authorities seized multiple computers and electronic devices from the suspect’s home.</p>
