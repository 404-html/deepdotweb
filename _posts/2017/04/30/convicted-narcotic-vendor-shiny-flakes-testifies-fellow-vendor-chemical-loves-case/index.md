    <p>Recently, Maximilian S., AKA. “Shiny Flakes”, <a href="http://www.morgenweb.de/mannheimer-morgen_artikel,-metropolregion-was-mach-ich-eigentlich-hier-_arid,1031010.html">testified</a> in the case of the “Chemical Love” vendor group.</p>

    <p>According to court documents, on April 10, the 22-year-old Maximilian S., who was convicted for running the Shiny Flakes vendor shop on the dark web selling narcotics, testified at the Landau District Court in Germany in the case of the Chemical Love vendor group. The judge was particularly interested in how Shiny Flakes organized his webshop and operation, and who he sourced narcotics from (which he resold to his customers on the internet) to clarify whether there were cross-connections to the operators of the Chemical Love vendor shop.</p>
    <p>In November 2015, Maximilian S. was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/07/shiny-flakes-sentenced-to-7-years/">sentenced</a> to six years and six months in prison after he pleaded guilty to the charges against him. Despite the prosecution’s request for 8 years and 8 months of imprisonment for the defendant, the Leipzig District Court imposed a lesser youth sentence for the suspect, who was under 21 when he committed the crimes. In March 2015, law enforcement authorities executed 38 search warrants in many locations across Germany including Berlin, North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. All of these raids were part of the investigation against Maximilian S. However, German investigators <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/12/shiny-flakes-bust-38-houses-raided/">arrested</a> the suspect, who was 20-years-old at the time, along with his alleged courier – a 51-year-old Bulgarian man – while carrying several kilograms of drugs intended for a “replenishment” at the end of February 2015. When law enforcement authorities raided the home of the defendant, they were amazed by the quantity of the narcotics they found. Investigators seized more than 320 kilograms of substances, including LSD, cocaine, hash, prescription pills, and MDMA. Police reported that Maximilian S. sold an additional 914 kilograms of narcotics on both the clearnet (the normal part of the internet) and on the dark web to his customers, making an estimated 4 million euros in the whole 14-month long operation.</p>

    <p>Chemical Love, a vendor group consisting of five members, similarly selling narcotics on the dark web as Shiny Flakes, was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/17/dark-web-vendor-chemical-love-busted-50-kg-drugs-seized/">busted</a> on April 14, 2016, when law enforcement authorities raided the group’s headquarters. During the raid of the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/drugs/">drug</a> depot, German police arrested the five suspects and found an astonishing amount of drugs. Investigators seized approximately 45 kilograms of amphetamine imported from the Netherlands, more than 3.5 kilograms of amphetamine, 1.4 kilograms of cocaine, 230 grams of heroin, 4,158 LSD trips, 2 kilograms of hash, 250 grams of crystal meth, 4.7 kilograms of MDMA in crystalline form, and 5.1 kilograms of ecstasy pills. In addition, they are expected to receive approximately 75 kilograms of amphetamine, 3.6 kilograms of MDMA, 2,700 LSD trips, 12,800 ecstasy pills, 1.67 kilograms of cocaine, 300 grams of heroin, 2.93 kilograms of hash and 2,300 kilos of amphetamine 165 grams of crystal meth. Police also found a list with 2,200 orders, which helped authorities in identifying and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/03/22/1000-investigations-started-customers-narcotics-vendor-chemical-love/">starting investigations</a> against the past customers of the vendor group.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-19511 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/04/chemicallove.jpeg" alt="chemicallove" width="1066" height="600" srcset="/imgs/2017/04/chemicallove.jpeg 1408w, /imgs/2017/04/chemicallove-300x169.jpeg 300w, /imgs/2017/04/chemicallove-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1066px) 100vw, 1066px" /></p>
    <p>During the trial, the 22-year-old Maximilian S. was asked by the judge to explain how his operation was running.</p>
    <p>&#8220;It was a crazy idea, I came across internet drugstore trafficking and thought I could do better, two weeks later I was in business,&#8221; Shiny Flakes answered to Judge Urban Ruppert’s question. The 22-year-old also added that he had designed his shop with a friend, he had never seen personally, called “Stupid Pig”. The friend, according to Maximilian S., helped with the packing of drugs, however, later he disappeared since the vendor did everything by himself. After Shiny Flakes said that he purchased <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/narcotics/">narcotics</a> from two dark web vendors for resale, &#8220;Godfather in Hell&#8221; and &#8220;Dutchmaster&#8221;, Ruppert did not believe the convicted criminal at first.</p>
    <p><a id="post-19493-_gjdgxs"></a> &#8220;Life is analogous. If someone wants to consume drugs, they have to buy them personally,&#8221; Ruppert said. However, later on, the 22-year-old convinced the judge when he told about how the payments were conducted in <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/12/wa-state-bill-ban-bitcoin-marijuana-shops-dies-companies-bring-bitcoin-marijuana-stores/">bitcoins</a> and the drugs shipped by the national postal service.</p>
    <p>&#8220;But as packets can weigh a maximum of ten kilos at packing stations, we have switched to courier drivers,” Shiny Flakes added.</p>
    <p>&#8220;There is no evidence for this,” a police officer said investigating the case when the judge asked if there would be a connection between Shiny Flakes and “z100”, the suspected chief of the Chemical Love vendor shop. All indications in the court trial based on this presumption lead to a dead end.</p>
