    <p>Law enforcement authorities in Taiwan seized approximately 511 kilograms of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/ketamine/">ketamine</a>, which they believe to be originated from the dark web.</p>

    <p>According to a <a href="http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/china/20170413/56559396">local news source</a>, the Taipei City Police seized large amounts of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/12/esu-student-arrested-buying-lsd-dark-web/">LSD</a> and 551 kilograms of ketamine in Taipei, Taiwan (Republic of China or ROC), which law enforcement authorities estimate would be enough for at least one million people to take the drugs at least once. Police claimed that the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/narcotics/">narcotics</a> are from the dark web, and are connected to “underground black market transactions”. The law enforcement action was conducted as part of the “closed city anti-drug project”.</p>
    <p>Investigators stated that most of the narcotics are from the darknet marketplace Silk Road. Police information did not disclose whether the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/15/three-young-suspects-bought-kilos-drugs-dark-web/">drugs</a> are from the already closed Silk Road or Silk Road 2 marketplace, or they are connected to the up and running Silk Road 3 site. In addition to that, law enforcement authorities did not state how the bust was connected to the darknet marketplace. There could be many possibilities how investigators seized the narcotics. One assumption is that the Taipei City Police arrested numerous darknet vendors and/or buyers, packed the substances, measured them together, and published a press release with the great catch. Another possibility could be that since China (both the Republic of China – or Taiwan – and the People’s Republic of China) is a big exporter of synthetic drugs, such as ketamine, to the global narcotics market, law enforcement authorities arrested a major darknet player, who sold the substances to his or her customers on the darknet and shipped the drugs from Taiwan to abroad countries. These assumptions might be confirmed or disproved in the future.</p>
    <p>Officers of the Taipei City Police pointed out the anonymous nature of the dark web. According to them, most users of the Tor Network use about 4-5 IP addresses, which the network constantly changes, to remain hidden from law enforcement authorities. Police also added that investigators spent hours with tracking and updating the IP addresses. According to Taiwanese law enforcement authorities, many users use the darknet in a “bad way”. Officials claimed that many of these cybercriminals visit marketplaces on the dark side of the internet to purchase narcotics, weapons, hacker, and other illicit services.</p>
    <p><a id="post-19492-_gjdgxs"></a> “Silk Road is one of the most known trading platforms on the darknet, where one can buy drugs, all kinds of weapons, bombs, fake passports, credit cards, ID cards or hacking services,” Taiwanese news site, hk.apple.nextmedia.com, disclosed. The media outlet described the Silk Road marketplace as one of the most popular ones on the darknet. Since there is a lack of information in the current case, this statement could refer to the currently running Silk Road 3 Marketplace. There could be also a slight chance that the author of the article was not sufficiently informed, and he or she referred to the infamous, and now closed, Silk Road Marketplace.</p>
