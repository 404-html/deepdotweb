<p>In early October, the Chilly-Mazarin Criminal Court heard the case of a formerly convicted drug dealer who had stepped up in the world of crime. In addition to cocaine and marijuana, police found a semi automatic in the suspect’s home. The gun, he said, came from the darknet.</p>
<p>Local news outlets reported that the 31-year-old suspect had not “escaped a prison sentence.” In a way, he came close during his Chilly-Mazarin case; the judge had ordered a two year prison sentence, but with a suspended year.</p>

<p>On numerous occasions in the recent past, <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/chilly-mazarin-91380/chilly-mazarin-prison-ferme-pour-le-dealeur-02-10-2017-7303698.php"><em>leparisien wrote</em></a>, that the suspect had caught drug trafficking charges for the purpose of reselling the drugs in face to face transactions. Outside of the scope of the 31-year-old&#8217;s case, darknet news spilled out of many French publications. And in one case, even Europol. One of the most recent incidents included the story of the former <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/dream-market/">Dream Market</a> vendor and moderator, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/09/29/dea-arrests-french-dream-vendor-oxymonster/">OxyMonster aka Gal Vallerius</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, France recently offered a list of translations for the “darknet.” They raised some complaints as the definitions provided by the Journal Officiel (of the French republic) left open ends. The difference between the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/03/02/deepdotwebs-darknet-dictionary/">deepweb and darknet</a> were ignored, according to critics.</p>
<p>In the recently closed case in the Chilly-Mazarin Criminal Court, no new definitions were needed nor did they matter. The court heard how the 31-year-old found himself in police custody yet again for drug trafficking, this time with a weapon. Drug trafficking itself was not unusual for the man. Nor was the actual drug party of the crime.</p>
<p>The defendant had, in the past, distributed drugs that he had ordered from darknet marketplaces. A fairly normal activity. Law enforcement caught the man, this time, after he made an illegal U-turn with hidden license plates. A police car pulled him over and discovered five containers of cocaine. Soon after, police searched the defendant’s Chilly-Mazarin home.</p>
<p>They found more than 40 grams of cocaine in the refrigerator. And under the sink, they found nearly 300 grams of marijuana. Include a semi-automatic weapon and ammunition to match. When questioned about the gun, he told police that he needed it for self-defense. &#8220;I bought it on the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet/">Darknet</a> to protect me. Two months ago, I was assaulted,” he said. A notable period in history where someone had successfully ordered a gun from the darknet. And later got arrested for traffic violations.</p>
