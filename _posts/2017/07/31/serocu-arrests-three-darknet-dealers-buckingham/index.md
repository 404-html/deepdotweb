    <p>After an investigation into drug trafficking by the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit, officers arrested three suspects for drug distribution through the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet">darknet</a>. The investigation, according to SEROCU, centered on darknet drug trafficking and fraud. A full investigation is underway as detectives examine seized evidence.</p>
    <p>In early July, SEROCU&#8217;s Cyber Crime Unit raided multiple homes in Buckingham. The raids resulted in three arrests: a 33-year-old woman, a 34-year-old man, and a 36-year-old man. All three were arrested for suspected drug trafficking crimes and money laundering conspiracy.</p>

    <p>Detective Sergeant Rob Bryant of SEROCU’s Cyber Crime Unit, the detective who led the raid, said: “Last week’s action came after a detailed investigation into fraud and drug offences online.”</p>
    <p>SEROCU detectives charged the three with the following crimes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Conspiracy to supply a class A controlled drug;</li>
    <li>Conspiracy to supply a class B controlled drug;</li>
    <li>Conspiracy to launder money or the proceeds of crime.</li>
    </ul>

Their Twitter account also pointed to a South East ROCU Reddit account where they posted the link in the r/darknetmarkets subreddit titled “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/6nz54k/serocu_project4_dream_market_arrest/">SEROCU &#8211; Project-4 Dream Market Arrest</a>.”</p>

    <p>The three purportedly sold ketamine, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/mdma/">MDMA</a>, and marijuana through <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">darknet marketplaces</a>. Detectives found those specific drugs at the raided houses. <a href="http://www.serocu.org.uk/32/section.aspx/30/three_arrested_on_conspiracy_to_supply_drugs_in_buckingham__serocu">The SEROCU press release</a> said the quantities were “significant,” but did not release a specific weight.</p>
    <p>Bryant added, “we have seized various quantities of drugs and digital items which will now be examined.”</p>
    <p>“The action should be a reminder to those that commit criminal acts that we will use our full resources to ensure you are caught and stopped.”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-21668" src="/imgs/2017/07/word-image-145.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2017/07/word-image-145.jpeg 800w, /imgs/2017/07/word-image-145-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
    <p>Authorities released the trio on bail.</p>
    <p>This is not the first case where (SE)ROCU investigated crimes associated with the darknet.</p>
    <p>In December 2016, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/12/12/two-sussex-men-charged-darknet-drug-sales-money-laundering/">a SEROCU investigation</a> led to the arrest of two men from Sussex and two men for from Birmingham. All four in connection with darknet crimes. The “ring&#8221; landed in law enforcement&#8217;s scope for offering money laundering services on the darknet. Upon a closer examination, detectives discovered that the four sold drugs.</p>
    <p>They sold, notably, the same drugs: cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, and ketamine. They received possession of class A and B drug charges, along with the conspiracy to supply class A and B drugs. The names of the three most recent arrests were not announced, nor was a court date revealed. A connection is highly unlikely, but of the few darknet drug trafficking crimes SEROCU investigated, two involved Birmingham; ketamine; MDMA; cannabis; and money laundering.</p>
