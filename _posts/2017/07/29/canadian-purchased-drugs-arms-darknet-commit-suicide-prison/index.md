    <p>A Canadian who was arrested for drug trafficking on the Darknet has committed <a href="http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2017/07/12/dark-web-le-quebecois-arrete-en-thailande-sest-suicide-en-prison">suicide</a> in his prison cell. Alexandre Cazes, 26, was arrested in Thailand and detained on July 5th. He committed suicide in the Narcotics Bureau in Bangkok, in his cell. The suspect was on the wanted list of the FBI, but he fled to Bangkok to escape the drug trafficking charges.</p>
    <p>A report has said that Cazes lived a luxurious life as he owned a Lamborghini. The Lamborghini was seized. After his arrest on July 5th at No. 514 Private House Phutthamonthon 3 Road, Thawi Watthana, Bangkok, authorities made sure that extradition papers were prepared. The cost of the car in Thailand is said to be four times more expensive than in the west due to import taxes.</p>

    <p>Cazes was a suspect for arms and drug trafficking on the Darknet, and he has lived in the Thailand for eight years as a computer programmer. A source has revealed that Cazes married in Thailand, and his way of living made him the center of attention. He was the owner of three different houses and several cars.</p>
    <p>A search was conducted in his houses in Trois-Rivières and a mini-warehouse in the Cap-de-la-Madeleine area which focused on his computer equipment. Another search was also conducted in Montreal.</p>
    <p>The Department of world affairs in Canada said: “Our thoughts are with family members and friends of Alexandre Cazes. Consular officers in Ottawa and Bangkok are in communication with family members. &#8221;</p>
    <p>The RCMP in Canada in <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/07/04/rcmp-takes-opioid-producers-storm-darkweb/">collaboration</a> with interested parties has raided the Darknet to arrest several Darknet operators and vendors. It is said that Cazes was exposed for arrest through the operation of the RCMP. They have busted several narcotic distributors. Their success is linked to the fact that they organize joint investigation with multi agencies in and outside the country.</p>
    <p>“In Canada, the collaboration between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Post, and the Canada Border Services Agency led to the identification and targeting of an international distributor of narcotics based in Quebec that was operating on the Darknet.” RCMP said. “This resulted in numerous seizures and the detention of an individual involved in the international distribution of the narcotics.” The force behind their operation has resulted in success, and Cazes is a victim of their operation.</p>
    <p>The arrest of Cazes was as results of a fresh worldwide investigation, where the FBI searched computer equipment. More arrests should be expected in the coming weeks. Some people also suspect that there is a link between Cazes and the Alphabay market. A Reddit user known by the name Saturne136 believes that the whole incident surrounding the suicide of the suspect and the timing for the disappearance of Alphabay is suspicious; “It seems there is a link between Alexandre Cazes and AlphaBay market,&#8221; he said. “If it is the case, in my opinion, 1) He should wait 10 years, 15 years before purchasing houses and cars cuz it was suspicious 2) Ban weapons from AB.”</p>
    <p>He is even suspected to be an Alphabay administrator. If it happens that he was the Alphabay administrator, then all hope for those whose money is locked up there is lost. Also, if the information turns out to be true, then it means Darknet market admins are slowly being taken care of by the police, ranging from the arrest of Ross Ulbricht and his co-administrator to other operators. Credible information concerning this rumor would have been provided had he not taken his life.</p>
    <p>More arrests are expected to follow, and the RCMP had a hand in the arrest of the many Darknet users from Canada. A lot of packages have also been <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/18/police-intercept-package-mail-containing-1kg-carfentanil/">intercepted</a> by authorities. A privacy expert, David Fraser, concerning the operation of the authorities on the Darknet that leads to the arrest of Darknet users and administrators who hide behind the mask, said; “the complicated thing is what they do when they get there and what they do with what they find. If police are monitoring and tracking individual suspects online and using it to build a criminal case, they may be required to obtain a warrant. Police may also find themselves in trouble if they surveil entire subsections of the internet in the hopes of catching a handful of individuals.”</p>
