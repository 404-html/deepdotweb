    <p>Roughly two years ago, a man’s name appeared on a “meticulous” log of buyers that Police seized from a major darknet vendor. That man, a 26-year-old from Gilching, a municipality in Starnberg, went to <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/starnberg/gericht-als-fake-adresse-ausgesucht-1.3563093">court in mid-June on ecstasy charges</a>. He denied ever ordering the packages and argued that someone used his name. The defense worked; he left the courtroom a free man.</p>
    <p>The vendor with the “meticulous” list of buyers, while left unnamed in the media releases, was described as a vendor that matched Shiny Flakes perfectly. Courtroom reporters revealed that law enforcement found the name two years ago. The list, found in 2015, belonged to a vendor who operated a massive operation of Leipzig. Reporters revealed one more piece of information: that the vendor received a seven year prison sentence—sentenced as a juvenile.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-21352 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/07/word-image-73.jpeg" width="560" height="326" srcset="/imgs/2017/07/word-image-73.jpeg 800w, /imgs/2017/07/word-image-73-300x175.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
    <p>In 2015, in Leipzig, law enforcement raided Shiny Flakes aka Maximilian S. The Leipzig Court charged Maximilian with the distribution of 914 kilograms of various drugs. At the time of his arrest, he had <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/08/17/new-information-regarding-the-shiny-flakes-bust/">320 kilograms combined weight</a> of MDMA, hash, speed, LSD, cocaine, ecstasy, and others.</p>
    <p>He sold an abnormally high quantity of drugs, yet the tale continued. At the time of his arrest, not only did police find drugs; they found distribution materials; almost 50,000 euros; a Bitcoin wallet with 1197 bitcoins in it; cell phones and a computer; and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/01/02/judge-closed-case-friend-shiny-flakes-fined-1350-euros/">an Excel spreadsheet filled with buyer names</a>. Maximilian marked orders incomplete or finished with different colors.</p>
    <p>And to add to the evidence, Maximilian was a 20-year-old who lived at his mother&#8217;s house. He received a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/07/shiny-flakes-sentenced-to-7-years/">juvenile sentence of seven years</a> in prison. Individuals who bought or worked with Maximilian have continually appeared on the news. The list incriminated many buyers and law enforcement knew Maximilian&#8217;s shipping location, which made matters worse. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/12/shiny-flakes-bust-38-houses-raided/">Raids on 40 different residences</a> occurred the day of and after the Shiny Flakes bust.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old from Gilching adamantly denied the accusations placed against him. He claimed that an unknown person simply used his name and address to order from a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">darknet drug shop</a>. Judge Brigitte Braun of the court in Starnberg asked the defendant is he knew anyone who would have used his name. He did not. His defense attorney explained that anyone his his multi-family residence could have accessed the mailbox. She argued that the prosecution heard no evidence that someone did not use his name to order ecstasy; thus, the judge had to free her client.</p>
    <p>However, the prosecutor disagreed. He demanded a sentence of two years and four months. Also, he demanded that the name on the list was not coincidental, and no “wild-eyed person who had chosen the young man as a ‘fake address.’”</p>
    <p>According to court records and the prosecution, the corner defendant ordered thrice. One test order of 10 ecstasy capsules. Then 250 ecstasy pills. And then “a considerable amount of synthetic drugs.”</p>
    <p>The courtroom needed only 10 minutes to conclude the case. Judge Brigitte Braun agreed with the defense. No evidence existed against the man. She dismissed him.</p>
