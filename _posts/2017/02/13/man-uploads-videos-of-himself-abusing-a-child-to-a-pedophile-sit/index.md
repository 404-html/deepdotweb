    <p>According to <em>n-tv.de</em>, German Police arrested a formerly wanted-man who repeatedly abused an eight-year-old girl and posted the videos on a “<a href="http://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Polizei-fasst-mutmasslichen-Kinderschaender-article19661477.html">child porn platform through the darknet</a>.” Police conducted the arrest on January 26, one day after they published his photos and asked the public for help finding him. The 27-year-old suspect from Traunstein, Bavaria, abused the girl on camera 26 times, according to investigators. The last video featured the suspect’s full face and other identifying features.</p>
    <p>The Bavarian man abused the girl between 2014 and 2015, but also actively participated in an online community for pedophiles. Many similar sites, in the past, required members to upload fresh content on a weekly or monthly basis. Often the level of participation varied depending on the membership status. One example displayed <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/20/police-infiltrated-darknet-forum-hunt-pedophiles/">in TheLoveZone</a> case, according to the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/22/australias-taskforce-argos-hacked-computers-located-us/">investigators at Taskforce Argos</a>, was account privileges; the more a user uploaded or participated directly impacted the user’s ability to become an admin or moderator.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18108 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-25.jpeg" width="755" height="503" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-25.jpeg 1000w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-25-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /> &#8220;It is unusual to find images of the suspect himself on the Darknet,&#8221; said Georg Ungefuk from the Central Office for Combating Internet Crime, part of the Public Prosecutor’s Office. Police distributed a description of the man, based on the details in the video, along with photographs of the man’s face. The BKA issued a press release as well, asking for anyone with information about the man to come forward. “Information will be treated with confidentiality in justified situations,” they said, clarifying that the suspect himself could not reveal his identity (any worse than he already had) and expect no repercussions.</p>
    <p>From the German Federal Police’s website: “<a href="https://www.bka.de/DE/Presse/Listenseite_Pressemitteilungen/2017/Presse2017/170126_OeffentlichkeitsfahndungMissbrauch.html">Public prosecution for a girl&#8217;s sexual abuse</a>.”</p>
    <p>The general public prosecutor&#8217;s office in Frankfurt am Main, the center for the fight against cybercrime, and the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) are jointly searching for an unknown accused person, who is suspected of being between 25 and 35 years of age, suspected of sexually abusing a child Recording of sexual abuse on a child pornography platform in Darknet.</p>
    <p>The Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Main and the BKA provide video and video files showing the serious sexual abuse of an 8 to 9-year-old girl by the unknown suspect in at least 26 cases. The recordings were probably made between June 2014 and August 2015 in Germany (<a href="https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/Presse_2017/pm170126_OeffentlichkeitsfahndungMissbrauch.pdf;jsessionid=189FA3C036754DAC465C179F9B366314.live2301?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">pdf</a>)</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18109 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-26.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-26.jpeg 571w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-26-300x183.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /> Soon after the pictures found their way into the public arena, the police began getting tips from many anonymous individuals. The Public Prosecutor’s Office distributed the pictures in areas with high levels of foot traffic, such as on buildings and near sidewalks.</p>
    <p>Interviews with police officials after the arrest revealed that they collected “<a href="http://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/videos/panorama/Mutmasslicher-Kinderschaender-in-Traunstein-festgenommen-article19671532.html">substantial leads</a>” in the case. They just failed to connect a name to the face. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/31/german-minister-pushing-facial-scanning-mass-transit-terminals/">Using facial scanning algorithms</a>, the police managed to catch him on camera on numerous occurrences but never with enough detail to fully identify him. After the arrest, investigators said that they believed the accused operated alone, but they seized several pieces of electronic equipment to verify this information.</p>
