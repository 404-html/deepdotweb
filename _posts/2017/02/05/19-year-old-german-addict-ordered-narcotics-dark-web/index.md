    <p>A 19-year-old from Waakirchen, Germany was <a href="https://tegernseerstimme.de/drogen-thriller-in-waakirchen/235071.html">sentenced</a> to one week in prison and to four <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/drugs/">drug</a> screenings for ordering <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/narcotics/">narcotics</a> from the dark net.</p>

    <p>The accused stood before court on January 18. The charges against him included drug trafficking and money laundering. However, the 19-year-old had his own version ready.</p>
    <p>According to the public prosecutor, the suspect ordered narcotics from the dark net. The prosecutor explained that the dark web is the hidden part of the internet, which could only be reached via the Tor browser. The dark net provides anonymity to its users, giving law enforcement authorities a hard time monitoring cybercriminals. Dark web markets are popular platforms for semi-illegal and illegal transactions. People can purchase all kinds of products, including narcotics and weapons, however, if they are not careful enough, this activity could end up with them in jail.</p>
    <p>The defendant set the delivery address for his narcotics package to a clinic in Tölz, where he was treated for psychosomatic illness. Police information says that the 19-year-old paid with <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoins</a>, however, he never received his order. When law enforcement authorities searched the suspect’s home, who still lives with his parents, officials found five plastic bags containing marijuana residues, small amounts of amphetamines and 15 empty packs.</p>
    <p>According to official court information, the 19-year-old, before his arrest, was treated for severe pain. The accused worked as a carpenter at a company, where the tone was so harsh that he was literally “hit on the stomach”.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Just like the boss has never spoken to me before,&#8221; the 19-year-old said. “At home, one was also strict, but not in the tone.”</p>
    <p>Despite the working conditions, the suspect remained at his job. He started using marijuana and hash for pain relief. However, the pain got so bad that he needed up to four joints to endure the suffering. According to the accused, he ordered the drugs for his own consumption, not for drug trafficking purposes. Although, the prosecutor had his doubts about the 19-year-old’s statement.</p>
    <p>“That amount would be enough for one year,” the prosecutor said. “That&#8217;s as if I would buy my Snickers chocolates for a year.”</p>
    <p>The public prosecutor expressed his concerns that the accused bought the drugs for resale purposes, not just for consumption. A police officer, who was involved in the house search, stated that apart from the plastic bags and the amphetamines, authorities did not found anything that indicated drug trafficking. Normally, at least a scale would have been found, which could be used for measuring the narcotics.</p>
    <p>In addition to the drug trafficking charges, the State Criminal Police Office (LKA or Landeskriminalamt) was informed about the suspicion of money laundering. Law enforcement authorities found 15,000 euros worth of bitcoins in the accused’s wallet. During the interrogation, the LKA could not confirm the suspicion of money laundering, which led to the charge dropped against the 19-year-old.</p>
    <p>Since there was no clear evidence for both drug trafficking and money laundering, the prosecution dropped both charges against the suspect. However, for ordering large amounts of marijuana from the dark web, the 19-year-old was sentenced to one week of prison and four obligatory drug screenings. By the adult criminal law, he should have expected a year in prison for his crimes.</p>
