<p>Bitcoin Rallies Ahead of Bitcoin ETF Decision</p>
<p>This week the price of Bitcoin rallied from $980, past $1000 to a monthly high at $1127, inches away from the $1139 high of January 5. This strong run was partly fueled by speculation on a the Winklevii Twins’ proposed Bitcoin Trust ETF. On March 11, 2 members of the SEC will rule on whether to approve or reject the application. With as much as $ 300 million expected to flow in if approved, lofty $2000 targets are on the table. This week’s rally was either pricing in approved ETF news (on insider’s knowledge), or it was, and is, a massive pre-ETF pump that dumps if the ETF is declined.</p>

<p>On last week’s analysis, I expected a sideways consolidation within the $980 &#8211; $1020 range. But the market proved me wrong. Over the past 7 days, price has broken past $1000, rallied up to a local $1066 high, corrected to a shallow $1039 bottom and is now seems intent blowing past an 18 month high.</p>

<p>Looking at the 1 hour and 2 hour chart, this rise up to $1134 on BitFinex is part of an unfolding 5 wave structure from the $974 bottom of February 13. The chart above labels this bottom as 2, a retracement of an impulsive wave 1. Wave 3, ongoing as at writing this, follows wave 2 as an impulsive wave, and should continue up to a peak price; perhaps $1134 further up past $1139..</p>
<p>Thereafter, a corrective wave 4 retracement follows after wave 3 peak, finds a bottom, before a last impulse wave 5. As as writing this, on the 6 and 12 hour charts, bitcoin is trading at $1127, still within a wave 3, so further upside could materialize. Even after wave 4, a 5th wave should inch higher or even break past $1139 high. Bullish hopes of breaking the all time high are certainly warranted, for now.</p>

<p>On this 3 day chart, another 5 wave structure is in force. This is a higher degree fractal &#8211; a self similar pattern appearing at every degree of a trend. The $1139 high was the peak of wave 3, that retraced down to $735 for a 4 bottom and has resumed a trend up in a 5th wave &#8211; the final leg in the direction of the dominant trend.</p>

<p>Wave 5 is typically terminal, and precedes a 3 wave a-b-c corrective wave in the opposite direction of the dominant trend. The current wave fractals will be no different, and is only a matter of time. The question is how far up will price overshoot?</p>
<p>From talking to traders, potential targets for a wave 5 top on the weekly and 3D are $1200, $1400, $1600 and $2000.</p>
<p>This means immediately after this peak, a 3 wave structure will correct to at least $750, the wave 4 bottom. This is why I am cautious at these price levels. While it looks bullish, the events after a top could quickly turn bearish. Watch out for either a bull trap or a bear trap</p>
<p>If indeed the ETF fails approval, then any ensuing correction down will be catalyzed by this news. If approved, then the anticipated $300 million expected to flood into COIN ETF will fuel a massive price rise.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Fundamental News</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin ETF for Dummies</strong></p>
<p>Spencer Borgart, of Needham &amp; Co., expects the COIN ETF will not be approved, and will either be rejected or a proposed rule change, necessary for the ETF will pass by virtue of expiry of the March 11 deadline. Needham’s mini statement to investors in January stated it had a ‘very low’ probability and was drastically ‘overstated’ with odds below 25%</p>
<p>“<em>the confluence of fear, uncertainty and doubt coupled with basic incentives at the SEC will make it very difficult to get approval.”<br/>
</em></p>
<p>He is not the only one. Insider Vinny Ligham <a href="https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/833356565986021376">tweeted</a></p>
<p><em>“So far so good when I posted this at $810. Doubt the ETF decline (likely outcome) would even push it down this far [$700].”</p>
<p></em> ETF.com ‘s <a href="http://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/bitcoin-etfs-dummies">Bitcoin ETF for Dummies</a> is a great interview with Spencer and explores the Bitcoin Trust ETF.</p>
<p><em>“I definitely don&#8217;t expect a crash. There would be some downside to disapproval. We&#8217;ll see price slump a bit, but I would guess it won&#8217;t slump more than 10%.”<br/>
</em></p>
<p>I expect the ETF will not get approved. <em><br/>
</em></p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Weekly Price Forecast</strong></p>
<p>This week, I expect price to push further upside and break the all time high. I expect a wave 4 correction on the 1 day and 12 hour chart.</p>
<p>Beyond that, my gut feel says this run up is a fool’s trap: smart money exiting while dumb money takes the bait. With the looming ETF decision at large, a break of the high would suck in more late buyers and possibly drag this final 5th wave further up</p>
<p>My main concern is a top, and what form it might take, in anticipation of a break downwards. I still maintain a retest to $700 is inevitable. I too have been surprised by the energy of this recovery from $754, but, the more i ponder and stare at charts, the more i am convinced whatever top we get, will precede a 3 wave A &#8211; B &#8211; C correction to at least $700.</p>
