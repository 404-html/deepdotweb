    <p>Today, we are going to review and teach you how to use the Penguin mixer. The reason why we have taken an interest on this particular mixer is its open source nature. Like the mixer itself explains on the front page, the deep web relies on a multitude of open source services like Linux, Tor and Bitcoin. However, bitcoin mixers are usually closed source, meaning that one must place a great deal of trust, not only on the operators, but also on the code itself. With Penguin, everyone can take a look “under the hood” and see how it works. Furthermore, the code can also be used to create your own dark web mixing service and Penguin mixer even provides a tutorial on how to do this.</p>
    <p>Although its design leaves much to be desired, the mixer itself is highly intuitive and easy to use, and in the end that’s what matters. The major benefit of such an archaic design is security as no JavaScript is used.</p>
    <p>Another great thing about this mixer is the fee! The mixing fee in Penguin mixer is randomized between 0.5% and 1% which is lower than most mixers (yay)! You’ll also have the option of using multiple addresses and extended time delay which we advise you to use (both).</p>
    <p>Overall, the Penguin mixer is pretty great, but as always caution is advised! You’re entrusting your coins to a third party service that can disappear with them at any time. So, never risk more than what you can afford to lose.</p>
    <p>With that being said, let’s mix some coins!</p>
    <p><strong>Part 1 &#8211; Mixing your coins</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Click <a href="http://penguinsmbshtgmf.onion/index.html"><strong>here</strong></a> to go to the Penguin mixer</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Enter the address or addresses you want to send Bitcoin to</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18306 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-80.png" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-80.png 768w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-80-300x219.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></p>
    <p>If you specified more than one output address, your payment will be sent to you in <strong>separate</strong> transactions for each output address, <strong>with a delay</strong> between each payment.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> and choose the time delay you want to use (Fast or Slow)</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18307 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-81.png" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-81.png 768w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-81-300x61.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Click “<strong>Go On</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18308 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-82.png" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-82.png 768w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-82-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now you will be shown a Bitcoin address. Simply send your Bitcoin to the address displayed. Remember: The limits are 0.02 to 2 Bitcoins. If you choose more then one address, then the minimum is 0.02 per address (In our case, 0.08)</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18309 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-83.png" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-83.png 768w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-83-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Part 2 &#8211; Checking your mix</strong></p>
    <p>Now that you have sent your coins, it’s time to check the status of the mix.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Grab the your secret mixing key from the previous page (shown in Step 5 of Part 1)</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18310 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-84.png" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-84.png 768w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-84-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Now, on the top of the page, click “<strong>Check Mix</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18311 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-85.png" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-85.png 768w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-85-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Enter your secret mixing key</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18312 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-86.png" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-86.png 768w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-86-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Click “<strong>Submit</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18313 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-87.png" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/word-image-87.png 768w, /imgs/2017/02/word-image-87-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/></p>
    <p>Note that mixing information is only retained for 7 days (for your safety), so if it&#8217;s been longer than that your search won&#8217;t work.</p>
    <p>That’s it! Easy, right? We know. We just wanted to make sure you know everything you need to know before you start mixing. Now that you do, enjoy and remember to play it safe!</p>
