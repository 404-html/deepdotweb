    <p>Michael Ryan, a 36-year-old graduate from Kansas, US, was <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/american-gunrunner-used-shady-websites-9760581">sentenced</a> to 52 months in prison for running a vendor shop on the dark web. According to law enforcement authorities, the suspect sold <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/weapon/">weapons</a> under the pseudo name ”Gunrunner” on the Black Market Reloaded (BMR) marketplace.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-18275 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2017/02/http-i3-dailyrecord-co-uk-incoming-article976062.jpeg" alt="http://i3.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article9760625.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/gunrunner.jpg" srcset="/imgs/2017/02/http-i3-dailyrecord-co-uk-incoming-article976062.jpeg 615w, /imgs/2017/02/http-i3-dailyrecord-co-uk-incoming-article976062-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>
    <p>During the investigation, law enforcement authorities discovered that Ryan sold a powerful Hi-Point handgun and 19 bullets to a customer in Edinburgh. The seller allegedly sent the package using FedEx. After his detention, the weapon vendor admitted that he also exported <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/firearm/">firearms</a> to England, Ireland, and Australia.</p>
    <p>The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) arrested the 36-year-old in June 2015. The suspect appeared in court last year, where he pleaded guilty to six counts of exporting and trying to export firearms illegally. During an ATF raid last year on Ryan’s home in Kansas, law enforcement authorities found evidence that the suspect sold and shipped the Hi-Point pistol to Scotland.</p>
    <p>According to official court documents, the 36-year-old offered Glocks, Uzis, Berettas, Walthers with ammunition and magazines to his customers on the dark web marketplace. The suspect targeted markets like the United Kingdom, where the purchase of guns and rifles is difficult or banned.</p>
    <p>Ryan faced 10 years in prison, however, his sentence was reduced since he cooperated with law enforcement authorities after his detention. The court sentenced the 36-year-old to 52 months in prison.</p>
    <p>“With a computer and an internet connection, Ryan hosted an international arms trafficking business on the dark web, peddling firearms throughout the world,” assistant attorney general Leslie Caldwell said in a statement.</p>
    <p>On January 18, Stephen Carl Allwine, a Cotage Grove man, was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/02/06/man-tried-hire-hitman-darknet-kill-wife-got-scammed-arrested-instead/">arrested</a> for the murder of his own wife. The investigators described it as “one of the most bizarre cases ever seen.” The case started with a suicide call at Allwine’s home. Amy Louise Allwine allegedly shot herself in the common bedroom. A 9mm pistol was found on the floor, next to the wife’s elbow. However, something did not add up. The “victim’s hands revealed no soot, no gunpowder stippling, no unburned gunpowder stippling, and no blood on either hand,” a court document revealed.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement authorities started a thorough multi-agency investigation. They found out that the husband had access to the dark web and used it often. During the investigation, law enforcement authorities discovered that the man solicited the services of a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/hitman/">hitman</a> from the controversial dark net “murder for hire” website Besa Mafia.</p>
    <p>The hitman service site was allegedly hacked by a hacker, known as “bRpsd”, before. He leaked all the usernames and email addresses in the database. The hacker also claimed that the whole operation is a scam. Investigators used the leaked data and cross-checked it with the devices they seized from Allwine. They found the username “dogdaygod” and <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="01656e66656078666e6541696c606c60686d2f626e6c">[email&#160;protected]</a> (the username and email address the husband used in his dark net ventures) in the data dump. Law enforcement authorities discovered that the man paid somewhere between $10,000 – $15,000 in BTC to Besa Mafia for the murder Amy Louise Allwine. They agreed on shooting the wife at close range and burning the house down. However, the suspect got scammed.</p>
    <p>That’s where the suspect decided to murder his wife himself, police claimed. The footsteps—only visible with luminol—further pointed to the husband as the killer. Allwine was charged with one count of second-degree murder. The judge set bail at $1 million without conditions and $500,000 with strict conditions.</p>
