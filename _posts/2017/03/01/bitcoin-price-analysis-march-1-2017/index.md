<p><strong>Bitcoin Makes New Historical Highs</strong> &#8211; This week the price of Bitcoin continued up from last week’s $1122 to a new all time high (ATH) price across all exchanges. European exchange Bitstamp, clocked in at $1222, $55 above the $1163 high from December 2013. Soon after, price dipped back below the all time high on the 2H &#8211; 6H time frame. But, this has done little to quell optimistic hopes of a continued rally to $1400. With an ETF decision on the line, after months of delay, speculation is rife in Bitcoin forums. Bitcoin looks set to have a go at the new $1220 all time high!</p>

<p>At publishing last week’s analysis, price was hovering below $1127, after $1140 resistance pushed back. A shallow dip to $1127 followed, forming a firm base for a brief correction. The trend picked up again from this bottom, pushing past $1140, and rising sharply to break the December 2013 high, to a record $1220 historical high. Price was unable to hold above the ATH and fell to $1095 within a short span of 12 hours. Hardly surprising.</p>

<p>Using Elliott Wave predictive five wave pattern, I had been anticipating a corrective wave (iv) on the short term charts &#8211; 2H, 4H and 6H. Here, a 5 wave structure was clearly forming as seen above. EW guidelines state wave (iv) should not retrace beyond wave (i) at $1020. Any decline below (i) was out of the question.</p>
<p>Price behaved as expected, first declining sharply to a low $1096, before retracing back a long candle wick to $1075. The trend has coiled up into a consolidation pattern forming higher and higher lows. A solid double dip bottom preempted an advance to above $1200 only briefly. The inevitable wave (v) is underway. As at writing this, bitcoin sits above $1197.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18463 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/btc-usd-3-day-chart-wave-1-to-5-jpeg.jpeg" alt="BTC USD 3 day chart wave 1 to 5.jpeg" width="736" height="245" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/btc-usd-3-day-chart-wave-1-to-5-jpeg.jpeg 1309w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/btc-usd-3-day-chart-wave-1-to-5-jpeg-300x100.jpeg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/btc-usd-3-day-chart-wave-1-to-5-jpeg-1024x341.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></p>
<p>On the 3 day chart, price is clawing back up from a shallow $754 retracement. On this longer term charts, just like on the 12 hour chart, a wave 5 fractal is under way after a 4th wave correction. Estimates for a wave 5 top vary depending of the reversal pattern that forms. Wave 5s are terminal and mark an end to the trend.</p>
<p>In the coming days, one of several structures will form</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18464 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/truncated-5th-wave-jpeg.jpeg" alt="Truncated 5th wave.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/truncated-5th-wave-jpeg.jpeg 792w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/truncated-5th-wave-jpeg-300x164.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" /></p>
<p>One alternative is a truncated 5th wave as seen above. In this pattern, the top roughly equals or the top of the 3rd wave. After this top, a correction of the whole wave structure kicks in.<br />
<img class="wp-image-18465 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/head-and-shoulder-wave-5-jpeg.jpeg" alt="head and shoulder wave 5.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/head-and-shoulder-wave-5-jpeg.jpeg 793w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/head-and-shoulder-wave-5-jpeg-300x168.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /><em><br />
</em><br />
    A second alternative is a head and shoulder top. The first left shoulder would be the wave 3 top, a 5th wave break out higher than 3 would form a head, followed by a retrace to the neckline (a), to form a lower high (b) as a second right shoulder.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18466 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leading-diagonal-wave-5-jpeg.jpeg" alt="leading diagonal wave 5.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leading-diagonal-wave-5-jpeg.jpeg 794w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leading-diagonal-wave-5-jpeg-300x173.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p>A third alternative that is an impulsive ending diagonal triangle pattern that frequently appears in the wave 5 position.</p>
<p>These are only examples to stimulate thought on what to look out for in a top. In all these possible formations, price makes a new high, even marginally, but only as a terminal peak. The bull trend from 2015 is nearing its end, telling from shortening consolidation times and a hastening trend. No correction for the whole magnitude of the wave marked J has occurred.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18467 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/retracement-of-j-jpeg.jpeg" alt="Retracement of J.jpeg" width="1048" height="350" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/retracement-of-j-jpeg.jpeg 1311w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/retracement-of-j-jpeg-300x100.jpeg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/retracement-of-j-jpeg-1024x342.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not the only one who is concerned.</p>
<p>Vinny Lingham, an expert trader who has been right on every single call, wrote in “<a href="https://vinnylingham.com/preventing-another-bitcoin-bubble-98dee44e2c7c#.xwy75u8y8">Preventing another Bubble”</a></p>
<p><em>“Today, I need to provide a warning about the risks of the price appreciating too quickly. If March 11th comes and the ETF is declined, I doubt we will see any more than a $150 decline in the price. If that happens, this will be a strong buying opportunity, for sure.”</em></p>
<p>The Winklevoss COIN ETF decision on March 11 continues to weigh over the market. Probabilities of an approval range from 10 -15% by Vinny Lingham and below 25% by Block Capital’s Spencer Borgart. Vinny projects a price fall of $150 to $200, while Needham’s Report forecasted a fall of 10%; a target of $1000 in both if the ETF fails approval.</p>
<p>I do not expect the ETF will be approved, and expect a decline immediately after or days before. I expect a decline to the $700 &#8211; $800 zone after, which is the 38.1% fibonacci retracement level of peak $196 low in August 2015 and (if) we get a $1400 top.</p>
<p><em><br />
</em><strong>Bitcoin Weekly Price Forecast<br />
</strong><br />
    This week i expect price to have another go at the new $1220 high and possibly break up to $1400. As we approach the ETF deadline, new highs are a high probability, but with caution. Whatever top we get in the coming weeks will be terminal.</p>

<p>Expert trader Peter Brandt has <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/835559905658470400">tweeted</a> he expects a reversal too, and compared the current Bitcoin highs as reminiscent of the chart above; Silver XAGUSD high from 2011 .</p>
<p>“<em>the end is at hand or near. BTCUSD smells a lot like Silver did in 2011. If the blow off in Bitcoins is not THE end, then it&#8217;s the beginning of the end.”</p>
