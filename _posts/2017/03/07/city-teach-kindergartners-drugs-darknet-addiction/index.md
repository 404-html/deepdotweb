<p>Communities worldwide continue to blame the darknet for drug problems or usage in schools and other youth organizations. Some countries, for instance, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/02/10/bavaria-sees-increase-drug-overdoses-one-city-sees-darknet-drugs/">blame increased drug usage on the darknet</a>. Others, in contrast, report outdated drug laws led to more synthetic drug use. Some countries blamed an increase of drug overdoses on the darknet and an <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/12/16/turkish-health-expert-30-percent-drugs-comes-internet/">influx of synthetic drugs</a>. Some countries, or cities, have claimed to see no increase in drug use or overdose whatsoever. Whatever the case may be, many drug studies have shown that darknet marketplaces have changed the way drugs cross borders and enter bodies.</p>
<p>The most frequent argument used by legislatures is based on the ease of access provided by the darknet. Critics explained that drugs are now far simpler to obtain. No longer does one have to find a drug dealer in real life. Ordering drugs in the mail and having them arrive at the doorstep days, weeks, or sometimes <em>months</em> later, takes far less work. Drug studies have shown that a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/06/24/2016-global-drug-survey-shows-dmn-customers-ever/">small percentage of individuals would not have used drugs if not for darknet marketplaces</a>.</p>
<p>However, the majority of darknet marketplace drug users order drugs for different reasons. Many times these users partook in drugs before the darknet existed. The darknet just made the entire process far simpler. Another percentage of drug buyers were found on the darknet marketplaces because they offered higher-quality substances.</p>
<p>Additionally, studies have shown that many buyers look for hard to find or completely unavailable in their area. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/study/">Study participants often report</a> the inability to find LSD or MDMA nearby and especially at a high level of purity. The darknet marketplaces utilize a rating system where users can rate their experience with a vendor&#8217;s substance. Similar forums exist for the same reason. Individuals can compare experiences and find the pure substance obtainable. And in most cases, these substances are more pure than there would be on the streets.</p>
<p>Officials and humanitarians in the Herford district of North Rhine-Westphalia announced that children aged three to six years old should be taught the dangers of drug use. Klaus Brameier, a local newspaper writer, explain that young children flocked to cannabis because the fear of hard drugs, such as opiates, carried greater weight of consequence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We often hear from teenagers that cannabis cannot be so bad at all. Their argument: if it is already discussed whether it should be legalized, then there is nothing at all,” Uwe Holdmann, a social worker, added. “However, this idea is highly dangerous. Especially for young people who are growing up in a difficult social environment where drugs and alcohol are part of everyday life.” He noted that many of the youth in the district when home two parents who were dependent on substances of some sort.</p>
<p>The solution, some of the humanitarians and activists decided, involved educating children at a young age. Diakonisches Werk, a charitable organization in Germany, explained that <a href="https://www.tag24.de/nachrichten/drogen-konsum-verboten-cannabis-opiate-kreis-herford-praevention-aufklaerung-jugendliche-kinder-auswertung-diakonie-werk-216595">children saw no repercussions associated with marijuana</a> use. And, as a result, children at a younger and younger age used marijuana. The darknet delivered the majority of this marijuana, the group lectured.</p>
<p><a id="post-18481-_gjdgxs"></a><em>“Meanwhile it was also easy to get drugs and prohibited substances at all. The Internet, especially the so-called Dark Net, plays an important role here, which is no longer alien to the young people today. The risk of being discovered at all is also being lost, and these new paths mean that the risk is completely reduced,&#8221; Holdmann said.</em></p>
<p>They argued that since drugs now came straight through the mail to a child&#8217;s front door, the risk of getting caught decreased tremendously. As more of the “youth,” started ordering and using marijuana, other children saw fewer and fewer risks associated with cannabis use. Therefore, drug education, including the risks associated with darknet marketplaces, should be taught to be all age groups—including kindergartners—they agreed.</p>
