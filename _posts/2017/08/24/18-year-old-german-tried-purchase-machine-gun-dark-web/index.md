    <p><a id="post-22143-_gjdgxs"></a> A young man was <a href="http://www.infranken.de/regional/hassberge/kreis-hassberge-18-jaehriger-versuchte-maschinenpistole-im-darknet-zu-kaufen;art217,2810566#cookie_accepted">arrested</a> by German law enforcement authorities for attempted purchase of a machine gun from the dark web. When investigators searched his apartment, they discovered multiple pieces of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/08/09/german-father-bought-drugs-counterfeit-euro-notes/">counterfeit</a> 50 euro bills in addition to a considerable amount of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/narcotics/">narcotics</a>. The defendant is facing serious charges.</p>

    <p>Recently, the police and the public prosecutor announced the arrest of an 18-year-old from the Hassfurt area who allegedly tried to purchase a machine gun, which is considered as a war <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/weapon/">weapon</a> in Germany, from the dark web.</p>
    <p>The investigations in the case were conducted by experts of the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office (LKA). The police officers were responsible for tracking down crimes connected to illegal arms trafficking and war weapons. The operation was conducted under the direction of the cybercrime headquarters in Bavaria and the public prosecutor’s office in Bamberg. The police action took place in Hassfurt on August 3. Law enforcement authorities announced the arrest of the 18-year-old on August 7. Investigators suspect that the defendant tried to purchase a machine gun from the dark web.</p>
    <p>According to the police, the 18-year-old paid $1,700 for the weapon, which he sent to a darknet vendor. However, since the defendant was identified quickly, there is a chance that the vendor was an undercover police officer. The police stated that, despite the fact that the 18-year-old used a pseudonym to conduct the purchase, investigators were still able to identify him and find out his real location.</p>
    <p>In a search of his apartment, the officials of the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office found nine false 50 euro bills, a fake driving license, a considerable amount of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/08/07/man-gets-probation-ordering-300-grams-amphetamine/">amphetamine</a>, as well as several objects, which are prohibited by the weapons law.</p>
    <p>The attempted purchase of a machine gun is a crime under the War Weapons Control Law. The accused also has to face a serious penalty for possessing counterfeit euro bills in his apartment.</p>
    <p>On the request of the Central Office of Cybercrime in Bavaria, on August 4, law enforcement authorities issued a search warrant on the home of the 18-year-old.</p>
    <p>&#8220;There are no indications for a terrorist or extremist background of the act, according to the current state of knowledge,&#8221; a spokesman for the public prosecutor’s office in Bamberg said.</p>
    <p>Since January 1, 2015, the Central Office of Cybercrime in Bavaria has been serving as the headquarters of the public prosecutor’s office in Bamberg. This central office is responsible for the processing of outstanding criminal investigations in the field of cyber criminality, the law enforcement press release detailed. Investigators of the Central Office of Cybercrime work in collaboration with the appropriate specialists of the Bavarian police, for example in the case of attacks on major industries or cycled criminal proceedings. The police added that, even if a case requires deep knowledge of the dark web and technology, the public prosecutor’s office in Bamberg is still doing its job to prosecute the criminals.</p>
