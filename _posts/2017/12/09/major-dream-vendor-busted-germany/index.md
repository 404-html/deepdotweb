    <p>The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) made yet another significant bust in November. This time, according to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/365431415/Rauschgift-Darknet-Mrdrogenkommandant-Announcement">the BKA’s press release</a>, German authorities arrested a so-called “top vendor” on both the Hansa and Dream Marketplaces. The vendor, a 29-year-old German National, used the pseudonyms “mrdrogenkommandant” and “drogenfahndung.”</p>
    <p>BKA investigators, the Central Office for the Suppression of Cybercrime (ZIT), and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Coburg opened an investigation into mrdrogenkommandant in August 2017. The investigation revealed that the vendor and his numerous associates lived in the Netherlands but made regular—even daily—trips to Germany. Mrdrogenkommandant and his conspirators sold more than enough drugs to warrant trips to various parcel reception stations at the end of every workday. The BKA learned of these daily trips.</p>

    <p>Mrdrogenkommandant had last accessed his Dream Market vendor account on November 9, 2017. Although his profile might not reflect it, soon after the 29-year-old vendor disappeared, his impeccable 4.86/5 rating started taking hits. Customers complained that nothing had arrived by the allotted timeframe or that nothing had arrived at all. Days after the arrest, the BKA issued a statement announcing their latest and greatest catch.</p>

    <p>On November 9, the vendor arrived in North Rhine-Westphalia with 34 packages. Before he had an opportunity to mail them all, the BKA grabbed him. “Immediately following the arrest,” German authorities wrote, “international law enforcement executed search warrants at the accused&#8217;s residential addresses [connected to] drug trafficking in the Netherlands.” Netherlands law enforcement seized more than 75 kilograms of amphetamine, ecstasy, heroin, marijuana, and cocaine. Police also found €400,000 ($477,320).</p>

    <p>The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Coburg connected the mrdrogenkommandant bust to dozens of recent darknet arrests in Germany. Many of the vendor&#8217;s customers—including one who had picked up a package from the Dream Market vendor on November 8—found themselves in the middle of a massive darknet crackdown by German law enforcement. By the November 9 arrest, the police had arrested six of the dealer&#8217;s “top customers.”</p>
    <p>According to the press release from earlier this month, the Criminal Police of Coburg identified 12 customers and had arrested two more. Days later, the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Tübingen and the Rottenburg Police Headquarters announced <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/11/23/german-dealer-busted-five-package-seizures/">the arrest of another drug dealer</a>. The press release said the dealer had received drugs from a “police-known” and “well-known” suspect. Several more darknet buyers have been busted, often in groups.</p>
    <p>The BKA added that they would be working with national and international law enforcement to capture darknet drug suspects.</p>
