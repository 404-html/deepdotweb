    <p>Xanax is the brand name for a powerful drug called Benzodiazepine Alprazolam and it is used for medicinal purposes to treat anxiety and panic attacks. Xanax is highly addictive and is only prescribed temporarily as its effectiveness diminishes the longer a patient takes it. It is so addictive that some patients require supervised withdrawal. The withdrawal process can induce anxiety, making addiction self-fulfilling and very painful.</p>
    <p><a id="post-23759-_gjdgxs"></a> According to a recently unsealed indictment, Matthew Lee Yensan, of Raleigh, North Carolina, was charged with possession and intent to distribute marijuana, possession of intent to distribute alprazolam (generic name for Xanax), distribution of a controlled substance by means of internet and possession of firearms to further <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=drug+trafficking">drug trafficking</a>.</p>
    <p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration received a tip in June that Yensan was mass producing <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=xanax">Xanax</a> from a unit storage in Gorman Street and sold the drugs on the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=dark+web">dark web</a>. The DEA agents then followed him for weeks.</p>
    <p>According to a recently unsealed application for forfeiture warrant, postal inspectors intercepted a package headed to Yensan’s home and found it to contain three pounds of “high-grade marijuana.” When agents tried to deliver the package, Yensan fled from his house and had to be chased down. In his house, agents found another 12 pounds of marijuana; two pounds of “shatter,” a wax derived from marijuana plants; prescription drugs; cash in a locked safe; several loaded guns and a rifle hidden in defensive positions throughout the house; bitcoin storage cards and other items used to trade in the cryptocurrency: including a fake South Carolina driver’s license he used to rent the Gorman Street storage unit.</p>
    <p>At the storage unit, authorities seized 400 pounds of Xanax precursors and benzodiazepine, 70,000 counterfeit pills of pressed Xanax with a street value of about $4 per pill, 200 to 300 postal shipping boxes containing various amounts of Xanax pills packaged in Mylar bags, three industrial-size pill presses, two electronic mixers and an electronic pill counter.</p>
    <blockquote><p>18-DEA-635639:</p>
    <p>50.0998 Bitcoins, valued at $286,520.26, seized by the DEA on October 12, 2017 from Matthew</p>
    <p>Lee Yensan AKA Jacob Mason Knight in Raleigh, NC for forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 881.</p>
    <p>18-DEA-635642:</p>
    <p>50 Bitcoins, valued at $285,949.50, seized by the DEA on October 12, 2017 from Matthew Lee</p>
    <p>Yensan AKA Jacob Mason Knight in Raleigh, NC for forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 881.</p></blockquote>
    <p>Authorities were later able to access Yensan’s bitcoins account and found the equivalent of $715,150 in it. In addition to the bitcoins, federal authorities also seized Yensan’s firearms and ammunition, a 2014 Chevrolet Colorado pickup, a 2014 corvette, two jet skis, the three pill presses from the storage unit and cash found at his home as proceeds from his alleged drug activity.</p>
    <p>Yensan is currently being held in the Franklin County jail awaiting trial.</p>
