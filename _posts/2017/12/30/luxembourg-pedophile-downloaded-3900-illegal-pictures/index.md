    <p>On December 13, a Luxembourg court <a href="http://5minutes.rtl.lu/grande-region/luxembourg/1107822.html">convicted a 33-year-old man</a> of possession of child pornography and for distribution of child pornography. He had downloaded the illegal pictures and videos from sources on both the clearnet and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet/">darknet</a> while going through a so-called “depressive” phase. The investigators focused on episodes in 2012, 2013, and 2015.</p>
    <p>At a previous hearing, the lead detective who had worked on the case explained that authorities in Germany made the initial discovery that led to the arrest of the 33-year-old. German police reached out and informed Luxembourg authorities that an IP address in Lamadeleine had accessed and downloaded a video containing child pornography. The address had accessed the video at some point in September 2014. The investigator did not reveal when the German police had alerted Luxembourg police of the IP address.</p>
    <p>Luxembourg police traced the IP address back to a house in Lamadeleine. The house belonged to the defendant. During and after the house search, the then-suspect fully cooperated with police. He even admitted that he had downloaded the video that the German police had identified. He admitted that he had additional child pornography on his computer. He said that he could not stop watching it and that it “acted on him like dope.”</p>
    <p>Investigators determined that the man had downloaded 3,900 pictures from sites and forums on both the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/darknet/">darknet</a> and the clearnet. The photos depicted the sexual abuse of children between the ages of nine and 16. He had only downloaded four illegal videos. The victims in each video ranged from 13 to 14 years old. He said that he knew he had downloaded and watched illegal material and that he had suppressed the urges to do so for a long time before he downloaded his first video. He said that he watched the video and looked at the pictures for roughly half an hour at a time and on on three to four days of the week.</p>
    <p>According to a psychiatrist that he had visited in June 2016, the defendant showed an interest in child pornography because of the innocence of children. He had no immediately noticeable mental disorders, she said. However, she added that he “showed signs” of being a pedophile. The defendant agreed with her opinion and said that he needed help and had known that he needed help from the beginning. In an expert’s witness opinion, his own suggestions that he needed treatment indicated that he was, in fact, a pedophile.</p>
    <p>The prosecution took a more relevant approach—instead of arguing whether or not the man was a pedophile, the prosecutor pointed to the 3,900 pictures of child pornography found on the defendant&#8217;s computer. The defendant needs to be behind bars for 12 months with supervision upon release, the prosecutor said. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/sentenced/">A sentencing hearing</a> will be held on January 4, 2018.</p>
