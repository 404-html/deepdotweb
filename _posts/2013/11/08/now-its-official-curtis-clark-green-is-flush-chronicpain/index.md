<p>As we have mentioned before in the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/11/01/silk-road-tales-and-archives/">Silk Road Tales and Archives</a> and later expanded in our post <a title="Permalink to The Silk Road Saga: Who is “The Employee”? – Part I" href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/11/05/the-silk-road-saga-who-is-the-employee-part-i/" rel="bookmark">The Silk Road Saga: Who is “The Employee”? – Part I</a> ,  Now its official &#8211; that the Employee from the Maryland indictment is in fact , Curtis Clark Green who was and admin on the silk road site, as it was published today on the Baltimoresun:</p>
<p>&#8220;An administrator with wide ranging access to the supposedly secret transactions on the Silk Road online market pleaded guilty to a drug charge Thursday after being caught in a federal sting in January.</p>
<p>Curtis Clark Green, 47, was unmasked as postal inspectors delivered a kilogram of cocaine to his Utah home after Green sent an undercover agent his address.</p>
<p>Green pleaded guilty to a drug charge in federal court in Baltimore and his plea agreement reveals more details about how federal authorities closed in on the operators of the secret Internet site. Green and his attorney declined to comment.</p>
<p>Green, who went by the names Flush and chronicpain on Silk Road, was paid a salary in his position as an administrator. He was also able to access messages between customers and sellers on the site, peer into their financial accounts at the market and provided regular reports to the site&#8217;s owner about disputes and possible law enforcement snooping.</p>
<p>To the outside world, Silk Road was set up as a technological fortress, using technology to mask users identities and locations and make payments difficult to trace. But Green&#8217;s plea agreement shows how those at the upper levels of the site had wide ranging access to users&#8217; information.</p>
<p>The extent to which Green helped authorities in their investigation, if at all, is sealed in the court record. But the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office said his computer was forensically examined after it was seized.</p>
<p>The sting against Green began to develop last December when the undercover agent approached Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged mastermind behind Silk Road, saying he wanted to sell a large quantity of cocaine.</p>
<p>Ulbricht tasked Green with finding a buyer, according to court documents. Green did so but also agreed to act as a middleman, which led the agents to him.</p>
<p>After delivering the cocaine package, authorities swept in and searched Green&#8217;s home, seizing $18,000 in cash, a Mac Book and his cell phone, according to court records.</p>
<p>Green, who is not in custody, is scheduled to be sentenced in February.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>The indictment itself revealing the picture behind the bust :</strong></p>
<p>EXHIBIT A<br/>
    STIPULATED FACTS</p>
<p>Starting no later than November 2012,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> the defendant worked for the creator and operator of</span><br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Silk Road, Ross Uibricht, a/k/a “Dread Pirate Roberts.”</span> (The defendant, however, knew Ulbricht<br/>
    only by his alias and did not know Uibricht’s true identity). Silk Road was an online,<br/>
    international marketplace that allowed users to anonymously buy and sell illegal drugs, false<br/>
    identifications, and other contraband over the Intemet. »U1bricht collected a fee for each<br/>
    transaction on the website. &#8216;On Silk Road, the defendant was known by aliases, including “Flush”<br/>
    and “chronicpain.”</p>
<p>The defendant was paid a salary to serve as an administrator for Silk Road. &#8211; His<br/>
    responsibilities included responding to questions and complaints from buyers and sellers, resetting<br/>
    passwords, resolving disputes between buyers and sellers. Each week the defendant contributed<br/>
    to a written report which was prepared by administrators for Ulbricht documenting issues such as<br/>
    possible fraud by Silk Road sellers and possible law enforcement activity on Silk Road,</p>
<p>The defendant’s access as an administrator allowed him to see messages Silk Road users<br/>
    sent to each other, to see the details of transaction on Silk Road, and to see the Bitcoin accounts of<br/>
    Silk Road users and the administrators of Silk Road ‘ (Bitcoin is a digital currency that has no<br/>
    association with a national government, and was used on Silk Road  because it is difficult to track<br/>
    and easy to move online.) -The defendant could also view administrative Bitcoin accounts<br/>
    controlled by Ulbricht.</p>
<p>Starting in or about April 2012, an undercover agent (“UC agent”) with the Drug<br/>
    Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) began communicating with Ulbricht under the guise of being a<br/>
    major drug smuggler.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">That agent was one of several assigned to a Baltimore-area Organized</span><br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Crime and Drug Trafficking Task Force, named “Marco Polo,” focused on crimes committed</span><br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;"> through Silk Road.</span></p>
<p>In December 2012, Ulbricht set out to find a seller of drugs on Silk Road who oould<br/>
    purchase larger quantities of drugs on Silk Road from the UC agent* Ulbricht directed his<br/>
    administrators, including the defendant, to assist. *The defendant assisted the UC agent establish<br/>
    contact with a buyer for substantial quantities of drugs. The buyer was an established seller of<br/>
    drugs on Silk Road (the “Vendor”). The UC agent and the Vendor than negotiate a deal for one<br/>
    kilogram of cocaine for approximately $27,000 in Bitcoin. The Vendor told the UC agent that<br/>
    this deal was intended to be the first of many with the UC agent.</p>
<p>Without the knowledge of either Ulbricht or the UC agent, the defendant agreed to act as a<br/>
    middle-man for the Vendor. Specifically, the defendant agreed to take delivery of drugs on &#8216;<br/>
    behalf of the Veridor. As ti result, the Vendor provided the defendant an address to the UC agent as<br/>
    the place to which the cocaine was to be delivered.</p>
<p>Ou January 17, 2013, the defendant took delivery of” approximately one kilogram of<br/>
    cocaine at his residence in Utah. A United States Postal Inspector, working undercover, delivered<br/>
    the cocaine to the defendants residence. Shortly after the defendant accepted delivery of the<br/>
    cocaine, federal agents executed an anticipatory Search warrant on his residence. among those<br/>
    executing the warrant were federal agents assigned to the Marco Polo Task Force ,including agents<br/>
    with the DEA, Homeland Security Investigators, the United States Postal Inspectors, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and the</span><br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;"> United States Secret Service.</span></p>
<p>The agents found the defendant with the package of cocaine, which he had opened.<br/>
    According to lab analysis, the net weight of the cocaine was 1092 grams.</p>
