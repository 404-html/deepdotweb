<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As it was posted at the The Baltimore Sun:</span></strong></p>
<p><em>An Edgewood drug dealer pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court to supplying customers around the world through the Silk Road online marketplace.</em></p>
<p><em>Jacob Theodore George IV, 32, admitted to agents with the Department of Homeland Security in January 2012 that he sold heroin and methylone — a synthetic drug often marketed as &#8220;bath salts&#8221; — using the hidden site.</em></p>
<p><em>Silk Road was taken down and its alleged founder arrested at a San Francisco library early last month. George&#8217;s attorney said he had been in custody since last year, but the charges against him were not filed until after the bust. A Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman said George was among the first people to plead guilty as part of the investigation into the site.</em></p>
<p><em>George&#8217;s alias, listed in court documents as &#8220;digitalink,&#8221; first appeared in the Silk Road forums, which are still online, on June 29, 2011. Forum posts by that user portray a dealer who aggressively marketed his products — offering free samples and promoting their potency — but one who also fell into disrepute among some of his customers as authorities closed in.</em></p>
<p><em>George had been in trouble in the past. In 2005, the same federal judge who accepted his plea Tuesday sentenced him to two years and three months in prison for running an eBay scam&#8230;.</em></p>
