    <p>Today, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, released the following statement on the launch of the Silk Road 2.0:</p>
    <p><b>“This new website – launched barely a month after Federal agents shut down the original Silk Road &#8212; underscores the inescapable reality that technology is dynamic and ever-evolving and that government policy needs to adapt accordingly. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rather than play ‘whack-a-mole’ with the latest website,  currency, or other method criminals are using in an effort to evade the law, we need to develop thoughtful, nimble and sensible federal policies</span> that protect the public without stifling innovation and economic growth. Our committee intends to have that conversation – among others &#8211; at our hearing this month on virtual currency.”</b></p>
    <p>Chairman Carper and Dr. Coburn’s committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs <a href="http://www.politico.com//story/2013/08/congress-starts-looking-into-bitcoin-95464.html">began a formal inquiry</a> into virtual currencies in April 2013. In August 2013 Chairman Carper and Dr. Coburn wrote to the Departments of Treasury, Homeland Security, and Justice, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and the Federal Reserve.</p>

    <p>This statement is different from what you would usually hear, does it indicate that we are going to see some changes in the US Goverment approach? Probably yes &#8211; but not for the better,</p>
    <p>When you read the sub text of this message there are few obvious interpretations :</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Bitcoin Regulations</li>
    <li>Getting Stricter on mail inspection (including legistlation?)</li>
    <li>Stricter Legislation on drug supply being done / Facilitated using the internet or mail.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>One thing that we are sure of is that the &#8220;whack-a-mole&#8221; Game is not going to end either way, until the war on drugs will come to an end.</p>
