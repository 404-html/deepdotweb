<p>Are you from russia and looking for a domestic order?</p>
<p>Look no further!  as it was reported a few days ago on <a href="http://www.leavethewestbehind.com/2013/10/silk-road-is-dead-but-its-russian.html">some blog,</a> there is a thriving Russian marketplace at this called RAMP: Russian Anonymous MarketPlace  and you can find it in this URL: https://ramp2bombkadwvgz.onion</p>
<p>There is also report that this marketplace is now also accepting litecoins!</p>
<p>This site is basically a forum where you can communicate with vendors and use the on site escrow system, here is a nice screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2013/11/Ramp.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1339" alt="Ramp" src="/imgs/2013/11/Ramp.jpg" width="761" height="499" srcset="/imgs/2013/11/Ramp.jpg 1203w, /imgs/2013/11/Ramp-300x197.jpg 300w, /imgs/2013/11/Ramp-1024x672.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px"/></a></p>
