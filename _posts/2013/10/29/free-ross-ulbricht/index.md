<p>LOL &#8211; Just saw this as the background image of darknetmarkets sub reddit,Â  we shall call this one &#8220;The Free Ross Ulbricht Meme&#8221;. As much as im against turning ANYONE into a martyr, especially in this can, i still believe that he is jailed for the wrong reasons &#8211; a lost war that will become a joke in the eyes of history (assuming he did not really try to kill anyone).</p>
