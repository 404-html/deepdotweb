<p>Really&#8230;?  So quick, that should be interesting,   as it was reported earlier today at the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/bbc-silk-road-documentary-vice/">dailydot</a>,  Source at the <a href="http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/bbc4-orders-vice-and-raw-co-pro-drug-doc/5062704.article?blocktitle=LATEST-NEWS&amp;contentID=870" target="_blank">BBC site</a></p>
<blockquote><p>BBC just commissioned a documentary on the Deep Web black market Silk Road. According to Broadcastnow.co.uk, the film will be coproduced by Vice and Raw TV, precisely the two outfits one expects to present a story like this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Director Emily James talks to Broadcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technology that enabled The Silk Road and the ideologies that framed its development are absolutely fascinating material. … So when Ross Ulbricht, AKA The Dread Pirate Roberts, alleged ‘operator’ of The Silk Road site was arrested at the beginning of this month, I knew immediately that it would make a gripping film.</p>
<p>I’m very pleased that Raw, Vice and Storyville have had the acuity to recognise what a fantastic film this will be, and to back my vision for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear DailyDot Report &#8211; i couldnt agree more with this sentence: &#8220;<strong>This is only the latest media effort at capitalizing on Silk Road’s infamy.</strong>&#8221;</p>
