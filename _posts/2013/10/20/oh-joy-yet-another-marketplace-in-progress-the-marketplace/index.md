    <p>Was just posted on reddit a progress report for another marketplace on the way, owner was nice enough to share photos and quite a lot of general information,</p>
    <p>links to the original post:  http://www.reddit.com/r/themarketplace/comments/1oto9s/site_preview_and_more_information/</p>
    <p>There&#8217;s even a subreddit already: http://www.reddit.com/r/themarketplace/</p>
    <p>Unlike the other marketplaces &#8211; this one will not be available on the TOR network as an .onion domain but on the i2p network,  as the owner explains in another reddit post:</p>
    <blockquote><p><code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br/>
    Hash: SHA512</code></p>
    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>We would like to explain our decison to use i2p rather than Tor. We feel that the recent events have<br/>
    shown that given enough resources, Tor hidden services can be identified. We feel that moving to a<br/>
    completly distributed platform built on the simple rule of &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust anyone&#8221; is the best choice<br/>
    for continued survival.</p>
    <p>i2p is not a tool for accessing the internet annonymously, rather a complete darknet which is purpose<br/>
    built with end to end encryption. Each end point is only known by a public key and being distributed,<br/>
    it also helps prevent a DDOS attack from providing a location as there is no main nodes. Every person<br/>
    connected to i2p is a relay for cryptographic information that is encrypted multiple times and passed<br/>
    along the chain to be decrypted once at each hop.</p>
    <p>We have done large amounts of research into all available hidden networks and we feel that i2p is the<br/>
    best choice right now. I2p is also included in Tails VM as of october which means it&#8217;s available to<br/>
    everyone.</p>
    <p>You may read more about i2p and how it works at some of the following sites.</p>

    <p>I took the liberty to post the screenshots here.</p>
    <p>text of the post:</p>
    <blockquote><p><code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br/>
    Hash: SHA512</code></p>
    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>As promised, we have taken screenshots of the steps that would be followed to place, finalize, recieve<br/>
    and review an order. We believe we have created a great platform that will become the new go to<br/>
    anonymous market place and are very excited to show it off to the community.</p>
    <p>Obviously the screenshots are using test data but it allows people to see what we have built while<br/>
    we finish securing our servers for a public launch.</p>
    <p>The homepage: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bd5f60011.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-599" alt="bd5f6001[1]" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bd5f60011.png" width="561" height="310" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bd5f60011.png 1680w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bd5f60011-300x166.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bd5f60011-1024x566.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px"/></a><br/>
    A quick overview about the market place and links to various categories.</p>
    <p>Catalog Pages: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/951743881.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-600" alt="Marketplace" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/951743881-1024x566.png" width="618" height="341" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/951743881-1024x566.png 1024w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/951743881-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px"/></a><br/>
    Form the catalog page, you can view all items for sale on The Market place and easily search for exactly<br/>
    what you are looking for. We support sorting by price only for now but will turn on filters as sales grow<br/>
    and you can also easily filter to show local products only. You can hover over items to view ratings<br/>
    to quickly let you know what the community thinks about this vendor.</p>
    <p>Product Detail Page: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/046633dd1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-601" alt="Item" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/046633dd1-297x1024.png" width="297" height="1024" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/046633dd1-297x1024.png 297w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/046633dd1-87x300.png 87w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px"/></a><br/>
    We support the full markdown syntax to allow you to create visually appealing listings as well as<br/>
    show as many images as you like. Product pages also show a vendors reviews and you can view a summary<br/>
    of their ratings as well.</p>
    <p>Cart: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/039abe1b1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-602" alt="cart" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/039abe1b1-300x174.png" width="300" height="174"/></a><br/>
    Vendors are able to set limits on purchase quantities so they don&#8217;t need to cancel your order and can<br/>
    also specify products as requiring seperate shipping. We support payment from your site balance, an<br/>
    external BTC transfer and even a mix of the two.</p>
    <p>Viewing Order: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/1e5a60a61.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-603" alt="1e5a60a6[1]" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/1e5a60a61-300x165.png" width="300" height="165"/></a><br/>
    Once your order is placed, if you choose to use an external payment you will be required to send the<br/>
    outstanding BTC to a wallet that will eventually move the funds to the tumbler. If the vendor has not<br/>
    approved you order you are able to cancel for an imediate refund of your BTC which will be transfered<br/>
    to your site balance.</p>
    <p>Order approved and shipped: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/873768a41.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-604" alt="873768a4[1]" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/873768a41-300x165.png" width="300" height="165"/></a><br/>
    Once the vendor has approved your order you will be able to open a dispute or finalize the escrow<br/>
    transaction. We support multiple orders coming from multiple vendors and ensure that each vendor recieves<br/>
    the correct amount for their order and is not able to see other parts of the overall order.</p>
    <p>Order finalized: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/d3d919901.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-605" alt="Finalized" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/d3d919901-300x165.png" width="300" height="165"/></a><br/>
    Once you have recieved your order and finalized, you are able to add a review or delete the order.</p>
    <p>Order Review: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/b4903a181.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-606" alt="Order Review" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/b4903a181-300x184.png" width="300" height="184" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/b4903a181-300x184.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/b4903a181-1024x630.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></a><br/>
    You can rank a vendor 1/10 for Stealth, Communication, Quality and Speed as well as leave a comment<br/>
    which will be visible to others looking at this vendor.</p>
    <p>Messaging: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/d9bbe5461.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-607" alt="d9bbe546[1]" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/d9bbe5461-300x165.png" width="300" height="165"/></a><br/>
    We support messaging any user that has shared their username with you and we will validate that the<br/>
    message you send is encrypted with PGP.</p>
    <p>Message encryption <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/c440d0b31.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-608" alt="Encryption" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/c440d0b31-300x170.png" width="300" height="170"/></a><br/>
    We also provide an option to automatically encrypt your message with the users PGP key, though we do<br/>
    not reccommend people do this as you communication is recieved by our servers in unencrypted text<br/>
    which although we do not store it, in a worst case scenario, a malicious party could read it. We only<br/>
    provide this to ensure people who do not know how to encrypt messages are able to safely communicate<br/>
    as well.</p>
    <p>Withdrawing Funds: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/d7277de81.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-610" alt="d7277de8[1]" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/d7277de81-300x165.png" width="300" height="165"/></a><br/>
    To ensure the safety of everyone, we require people create 1 wallet per btc withdrawn and a minimum<br/>
    of 4 wallets per withdrawal. We may adjust this limit as time progresses but for now, we feel this<br/>
    is the safest way as it helps prevents large money movements being tracked.</p>
