<p>If you followed our previous reports regarding the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/11/30/sheep-marketplace-scammed-over-40000000-in-the-biggets-darknet-scam-ever/">Sheep Scam</a> and the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/06/bmr-hacked-around-200000-stolen/">BMR Hack</a>, you probably remember the claims in both cases of a vendor hacking the site and stealing the users BTC, now, a reddit user claims to have found a links between the two cases and claiming that the hacker was a E-Book Vendor on sheep, and BMR and Tormarket, called Ebook101 on Sheep (as the sheep admin claimed on the shutdown:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="/imgs/2013/12/sheep-down.jpg" width="511" height="507" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that the same vendor was also on Tormarket and BMR under the name of &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221;,  A hackforums.net user (email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5f2f2d30393a2c302d37302a2c3a69661f323e3633713c3032">[email&#160;protected]</a>)  unlike most of the similar thread we come across &#8211; this one is actually very plausible!,  its very hard to believe that any BTC&#8217;s will be returned to their rightful owners as a result of this investigation, BUT &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>This might lead to the Doxxing of the Hacker in some way</li>
<li>This can tell us about the future of other markets (assuming the have the same security holes)</li>
<li>This might help to prevent such things from happening again</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway this is very interesting to follow.</p>
<p><strong>We requested <strong>Permission to post this investigation</strong> from the reddit user who posted the OP and goes by the name <b><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Gabralkhan">Gabralkhan</a></b>, and we were happy to get hes approval, we will try and reformat some parts for easier reading &#8211; this is a very long read, but its very interesting with many possible developments, we will keep and eye out for the OP and update if needed:</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m here to share with you a theory based on a strange coincidence that have been running on my mind for some days now. As Tormarket Site, alias TM, is not coming back i thought it was perhaps the moment.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong about all this and that this coincidence is just a coincidence, it can happen. As I was reading a lot about the SR 2.0 arrests last days, I eventually read also about the SheepMarket Story, that&#8217;s where this very strange coincidence hitted me and I&#8217;m going to tell you about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to spread FUD or misinformation but I feel i have to share this with everybody, perhaps people could confirm what I am saying or bring more elements, or correct me if i have done mistakes about the names. I remember them as spelled like this but I can&#8217;t verify anymore of course so if i have done a mistake please correct me.</p>
<p>A week ago or so, before the down of TM i was browsing through the categories with curiosity, i eventually ended in the section of ebooks, i had look at it in the past but I noticed that the numbers of listings had increased enormously.</p>
<p>As TM was growing quickly with new Vendors everyday during the last weeks it seemed normal but the increase was indeed impressive from a few dozens of ebooks to hundreds of ebooks listings.</p>
<p>And indeed it had a new Vendor named &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; that had put hundreds of lisitings, supposed ebooks writed by himself about Money. Mainly the listings were about &#8220;How to get XXX $ in XXX days with X hours of work&#8221;, a lots of different ebooks even sometimes duplicated through the listings and with a scale from a few $ to thousands $.</p>
<p>More you were supposed to get money with the methods detailed in the ebooks more the price was high basically, with ebooks at about 10k $ in the end which were supposed to help you to easily make thousands of $.</p>
<p>It seemed to me a little strange to see so much listings for a single Vendor but my first guess was that he was occupying the field and wanted to get as much visibility as he could on the Welcome Page of TM in the aleatory listings shown.</p>
<p>More i was reading through his listings more i was thinking all these ebooks were BS, i can&#8217;t confirm personally that I must say. I don&#8217;t know, but people claiming to &#8220;help others to get money easily with a method they are using with success for years&#8221; have always make me doubt, &#8220;when it is too good to be true, it is probably not true&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Profile of the Vendor was also mainly Bullshit about how he used methods to have money easily for years now, that was guaranteed, and how he was so skilled now in this matter and wanted to &#8220;share&#8221; or instead sell his methods with people so they can also have plenty of money basically doing almost a few hours of easy work. That he had compiled a lot of information in his ebooks, that they were legit, writed by him after years of experience, and that most of his methods were truly unseen and unknown.</p>
<p>He had a few feedback&#8217;s, all on small listings with price of few bucks of course. At that time i was thinking, &#8220;what a stupid Vendor&#8221;, so much listings and not promoting the products well, and probably the ebooks are complete Bullshit anyway.</p>
<p>So what a loose of time to do so much for listings you will never sell anyway, who would buy a 10k$ ebook on &#8220;how to get thousands of dollars every month easily&#8221;? I ended here my exploration of the &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; Profile and listings and went to another more interesting category thinking that he had completely fucked the category, which was flooded with his useless selfmade ebooks listings.</p>
<p>I was thinking that it should not be permitted by the Admins, to be fair to the other ebooks Vendors, all their listings were completely lost in the hundreds of &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; listings, it was impossible to normally explore the category of ebooks.</p>
<p>As I was thinking more about &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; Profile and listings while doing something else i finally found the whole thing very strange indeed and put it in a corner of my head as a possible deceptive scam. Afterall the few feedbacks were not so enthusiasts about the products, saying they &#8220;will try the methods perhaps&#8221;, that &#8220;it might work&#8221;, and that &#8220;it was interesting&#8221;, for people who were supposedly getting easily money now they had bought an ebook they were not so enthusiastic for sure&#8230;</p>
<p>Now Let me first remind you some of the old facts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about SheepMarket, alias SM. SM was claimed to be Scam performed by the owner of the site, this theory was a lot relayed in the News, finally becoming the &#8220;truth&#8221;, &#8220;SM was a Scam from the start&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course there was another theory, the &#8220;hack&#8221; of SM, announced on the first page of SM Server, with details given by the SM Admin and SM forum Mods, it wasn&#8217;t too much considered really, and was taken as misinformation/FUD spread by the owner of SM.</p>
<p>A hunt was eventually organized following the money of SM on the Bitcoin Blockchain. What seemed to be a good idea at that time to get to the thief ended not well as the transfers ended in some Btc-e internal wallets, so totally useless until you can make the transfers match the Btc-e database which is of course not accessible.</p>
<p>There was so much excitement about SM being an enormous Scam that nobody finally trusted the SM first page article and the SM Mods statement of the Hack of SM. Finally, days after the events the whole thing is still not clear, SM owner was also Doxxed during that time but finally nobody was able to prove that SM Down was the result of a Scam from the owner, or a hack of the site, leaving no other solution for the owner that to close the site and make a statement on the server frontage.</p>
<p>The information given on that page was that a Vendor named &#8220;EBOOK101&#8221; had found a security flaw on the site and hacked the server and robbed all the bitcoins. Perhaps some SM users remind of EBOOK101 listings, ebooks of course, mainly on money and how to get money easily, listed on a small scale with increasing values, but also more regular and classical ebooks. The ebooks on money had however the same form, writed by himself, he was giving advices on how to get money easily and with minimum effort with methods explained.</p>
<p>Later SM Mods were giving more information to TM Admins/Mods on the TM forum, about the Vendor.</p>
<p>Here is a Paste of a part of the message of the SM Mod about the hack to the TM Mods :</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a moderator that means i can edit/move/delete posts on forums and ban users, thats all moderator can do!</p>
<p>! ! ! ! ! WARNING ! ! ! ! !</p>
<p>Folks, leave sheep asap, admin took all money and did leave market. The reason is probably that one vendor did use bug in marketplace and did steal 5500BTC from sheep pocket. Then the problems with withdrawals happened, there were no tumbler, we were all fooled :/ we, the mods realized all facts just right now, we do hope that some of you can save btc after reading this.</p>
<p>PLEASE DO NOT DEPOSIT, YOU WONT BE ABLE WITHDRAW, NEVER EVER!</p>
<p>THERE IS PROOF OF MY WORDS:</p>
<p>username on sheep: EBOOK101 email on clearnet: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="78080a171e1d0b170a10170d0b1d4e413815191114561b1715">[email&#160;protected]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>The Bitcoin addresses involved in the hack or a part of it were given after.</p>
<p>you can fin the whole Paste with all the addresses and the TM forum Mod Introduction here :</p>
<p>http://pastebin.com/Zmx5D5R6</p>
<p>&#8220;EBOOK101&#8221; was registered with a mail &#8220;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a4d4d6cbc2c1d7cbd6cccbd1d7c1929de4c9c5cdc88ac7cbc9">[email&#160;protected]</a>&#8221; which was of course a fake mail, leading to nothing, impossible to go further in the investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey wait there!! what was that mail again? &#8220;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b7c7c5d8d1d2c4d8c5dfd8c2c4d2818ef7dad6dedb99d4d8da">[email&#160;protected]</a>&#8221;? Strange coincidence the Name of this so strange Vendor that was multiplying his listings on TM to hundreds was also &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something was surely strange there, perhaps just a coincidence for sure, but for sure also it would have perhaps explained the hundreds of listings.</p>
<p>The listings were not made to be sold but to study the TM Site along with some other actions and find a security flaw like on SM and exploit it to stole the Bitcoins. SM and TM were afterall sharing some common points in their structure and a hack performed in SM could have been performed again in TM in a similar way, and even in less time than for SM knowing the exact method.</p>
<p>Of course the registered email associated with the account EBOOK101 could be a basic mistake or perhaps the hack wasn&#8217;t planned at the time he registered. In any case it wouldn&#8217;t be the first one to do mistakes with emails.</p>
<p>The Great and Original DPR, founder of SilkRoad 1.0, the mother of all DarkMarkets was caught partly because he posted on some forums about Silkroad and Bitcoin and that the account was associated with an email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ebb9849898be8789998288839fab93939393">[email&#160;protected]</a> (of course it was long time before the SR success when it was only a growing project but it sounds like a big fail in these days).</p>
<p>As everybody was claiming SM a scam, TM probably didn&#8217;t pay so much attention to his security and the possible Hack of SM, the DPR 2.0 Database leak (made by a german hacker Zulu33 or not, nobody knows) have show that TM was not totally secured and could be subject to SQL Injection and Database exploitation.</p>
<p>Are the alleged hacker of SM, the Vendor EBOOK101, registered with the email &#8220;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ec9c9e838a899f839e8483999f89dad5ac818d8580c28f8381">[email&#160;protected]</a>&#8221;, and the Vendor of TM &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; the same person? Could he have performed two times a hack on DarkMarkets SM and then TM and stolen the Bitcoins stored, leaving to the owners of these Darkmarkets no solution but to shut down the Darkmarkets?</p>
<p>Were the bitcoins of TM stolen, wallets and escrow, and the site was shut down by the admins due to its impossibility to now operate, pay escrow to the Vendors, and leaving users with empty wallets?</p>
<p>Is this the reason why some people were talking about bitcoins movement on the TM addresses while the site was Down and that the previously so present Admins and Mods of TM have made no statement since the Down of TM?</p>
<p>Did they prefered to shut down the server right away and to disappear, knowing that they would be called scammers anyway and that they could not anymore get the bitcoins stolen back? Contrary to SM who tried to figure out a solution to the hack and robbery of bitcoins, leaving the Site functioning, hoping to solve the problem, blocking the withdrawals as they had anymore bitcoins to honour them until it was obvious there was no solution for SM to get the bitcoins back.</p>
<p>I left all this to your judgement, feel free to comment and correct my mistakes on the names of the facts mentioned if i made some, to add you reactions, suggestions, feelings, and more important if you have confirmations of what i say here or facts about all this don&#8217;t hesitate.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT : It seems confirmed by multiple BMR users that there was a &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; or &#8220;Professorhouse&#8221; Vendor also on BMR.</strong></p>
<p>BMR have been put back up for a few days (Official Closure postponed to the 30/12/2013) to allow some Vendors to withdraw their Bitcoins, and i was able to browse it to look for a Vendor with the name &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; or &#8220;Professorhouse&#8221;.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s gone, if he was there, as i had multiples assertions of users that there was surely a Vendor with this name on BMR i have to assume he was there but he&#8217;s no more in the listings or in the Vendor list.</p>
<p>A few possibilities :</p>
<ul>
<li>He closed his shop, his profile and his listings</li>
<li>He was banned or deleted, perhaps for the hack attempt of BMR, perhaps for something else.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suppose Backopy could say more about this, as the owner of BMR he should have access to the information.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2 :A friendly user have pasted in this thread a piece of the BMR Database extract which is publicly available. Our mysterious Vendor &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; don&#8217;t have anymore listings or Vendor Profile on BMR so it is the only mean to have information on him.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Since parts of the BMR db-dump are public available:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems there was indeed a &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; Seller on BMR and that was doing exactly what i was explaining, selling &#8220;Money making&#8221; ebooks of all kind and prices, the best part is&#8230; what was his email associated with account, a fake one of course?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b9c9cbd6dfdccad6cbd1d6cccadcf9d4d8d0d597dad6d4">[email&#160;protected]</a>&#8221;, no shit!!!! doesn&#8217;t that sounds very close to our alleged hackeur &#8220;EBOOK101&#8221; attached email &#8220;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3343415c5556405c415b5c464056050a735e525a5f1d505c5e">[email&#160;protected]</a>&#8221;?</p>
<p>I think it is perhaps time to begin to rethink these stories of a SM Scam and the TM Down, at least the story of the SM Scam, and at the light of all these things, to see a &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; Vendor doing strange things with listings on TM before it was down a little bit like Sheep is more than worrying about TM.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3 : More News from users and they are not good; it is not the first time the Vendor &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; anormal and strange behavior have been noticed.</strong></p>
<p>The user &#8220;Poweraid4&#8221; on Reddit.com wanted to bring attention of people on &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; Vendor on BMR, it wasn&#8217;t seen so much, It&#8217;s going in the very same sense. In middle of all the the SM &#8220;Scam&#8221; excitement it was not considered and the information not even used&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m raging to think that, this post has more than 20 days, meaning eveybody could have done the maths far more earlier on &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; on TM, and would have been able to get to the guy on TM while he was still on it in the last days (just before the down)&#8230;.[FACEPALM]

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 4 : SR 2.0 Forum have relayed my news posted here.</strong></p>
<p>http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=11480.0</p>
<p>Some users are backing up all this even bringing more details about the possible hack method using SQL Injection.</p>
<p>Some assertions have been made on me and my possible link to SM Admin/Mods Team, how ridiculous this can be&#8230;</p>
<p>However i am here on clearnet, i can be probably more than easily Doxed and obviously I&#8217;m not running anywhere.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say how sad I am that some people just questioned &#8220;my identity&#8221; after reading the OP I have done, so much efforts to write this hoping this will bring a global moove of some people to look after &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; identity and the elements that could help and finally I&#8217;m the one identity which is questioned.</p>
<p>I guess i was perhaps a little idealist about the community created since SilkRoad and its maturity and fraternity&#8230;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 5 : Here is the pas of the own forum of the Vendor &#8220;Bungee54&#8221; as you can probably remember he was close to the TM Team and helped with TM and its forum.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Honestly we wish we had any fucking infos about anything at all..</p>
<p>First time ever we held our hands up for a market and if TM is running with monies now as well we feel really terrible.</p>
<p>We are already counting our losses for TM and SR2 and first time ever the become a bit threatening.( not really threatening but first time we ask ourselves if this is really worth it).</p>
<p>to make one thing clear -&gt;</p>
<p>We only had administrative privileges regarding the vendor batches , FE rights and some minor stuff and helped with scammer accounts etc. We really have no clues what is going on right now&#8230;.</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>And yes , we suddenly stopped posting because we moved everything and the whole team dispensed for security reasons.</p>
<p>But nobody got arrested and we are not associated with the TM admins BR &amp; prof in any way. We prepare a list of markets where you can find us in the future and a new rule set with an extra site where you can order in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>LAST Thing ABOUT ORDERS</p>
<p>Quote from: vividdreams on December 24, 2013 I know things suck for everyone right now but i gotta ask,what happens to the orders marked as &#8220;in transit&#8221; before the CRASH? Is there any chance you can complete the shipping Bungee??..Haven&#8217;t lost all hope yet</p>
<p>All open orders are 100% securely encrypted and stashed away.</p>
<p>But they all are on hold for now as the team dispensed and we will only regroup after new years eve. We will see what happens.But you can count on the Bungee Team as usual :)</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 6 :</strong></p>
<p>I have located a &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; on clearnet.</p>
<p>guess where?</p>
<p>&#8220;Hackforums.net&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=1828945" target="_blank">http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=1828945</a></p>
<p>I have of course no confirmation he s linked with the other accounts but look at his threads at start :</p>
<p>&#8220;Money Making ebooks&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hacking Services&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin exchange&#8221;</p>
<p>and ebooks&#8230;</p>
<p>Damn this sounds very familiar&#8230;</p>
<p>I have also a strange feeling about his threads and posts on Hackforums.net, he is only &#8220;giving&#8221; Documents on PDF, often only by PM.</p>
<p>In Computer hacking, Pdf files and documents are one way to hack personal computers and install keyloggers, and viruses.</p>
<p>This is pure speculations but the ways he is distributing his &#8220;ebooks&#8221; on the forum is strange for sure, often alleged &#8220;new money secrets&#8221;, &#8220;new weight loss methods&#8221;, ebooks about &#8220;secrets recipes&#8221; of KFC or McDonald. All ebooks are sure to attract the maximum individual attention, who wouldn&#8217;t like to make more money, loose weight, or know secrets?</p>
<p>Again this is pure speculations and i have no link to this hackforum.net account except the name. but the coincidences are very interesting for sure.</p>
<p>Second thing, Hackforums.net is on Clearnet, meaning the &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221;, if it is the same person, could have left possible tracks to his RL identity&#8230;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 7 :</strong></p>
<p>On BMR Forums I can&#8217;t access to his threads but he has made 10 Posts :</p>

<p>Damn i don&#8217;t know if all this points in the same direction but woot, that seems really too much to be only coincidences.</p>
<p>I know some points have to be discussed, as if the original statement of SM after the Down of the Market (let&#8217;s call it that way now) on the Vendor EBOOK101 hacking SM was true or not.</p>
<p>But if this statement was true (I really don&#8217;t see SM Admins picking randomly a Vendor to throw him as excuse for a hack), it appears that the same Vendor was doing fucking strange things in the TM listings a few days before TM go down. Honestly what are the chances that :</p>

<p>
    are not the same person? honestly? That very same person that was doing odd things with his listings in TM before it went down.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 8 :</strong></p>
<p>I am progressively more and more sure that the email addresses :</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f8888a979e9d8b978a90978d8b9db895999194d69b9795">[email&#160;protected]</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="90e0e2fff6f5e3ffe2f8ffe5e3f5a6a9d0fdf1f9fcbef3fffd">[email&#160;protected]</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>are not so fake.</p>
<p>On Hackforums.net, in an old thread of the &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; that exists there, about an exchange that ended as a scam, &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; pasted here a picture of the dialog he had with the guy which is the supposed scammer, the supposed scammer is suprised by the &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; email and ask him if it is :</p>
<p>&#8220;@gmail.com or just @mail.com&#8221;</p>
<p>so i went to check and &#8220;mail.com&#8221; exists really so perhaps the mail addresses &#8220;@mail.com&#8221; have been really used and can lead to tracks to the hacker RL identity.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 9 :</strong></p>
<p>I am more and more sure that the user &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; on hackforums.net is the very same persone that was running the TM account &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221;,SM account &#8220;EBOOK101&#8221;, and BMR account &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221;.</p>
<p>Too much coincidences, the ebooks, the money ebooks, Bitcoin, the trade he has done around bitcoin, too much.</p>
<p>I have also linked his account to a Youtube Video and a Youtube channel :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOXCCi0zT8U&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOXCCi0zT8U&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZCPhfXSmSrlkInK-LY_RQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZCPhfXSmSrlkInK-LY_RQ</a></p>
<p>The way he deal with his ebooks is really strange, he only deals with PM, &#8220;sending&#8221; PM to people for them to get the book. It is just a speculation again, but if i would like to infest people computer, people that have surely bitcoins, as it is a forum with a lot of trade in bitcoin what method i could use?</p>
<p>i would send them infested documents on demand and freely about subjects the majority people would like very much.</p>
<p>The documents would be forged with things picked on internet so they look legit, have a substance and content, so the people receiving them do not worry about anything, while their activity is monitored hrough a keylogger or while he use a bitcoin wallet stealing software.</p>
<p>Again it is nothing but speculations but it seems possible as a black hacker strategy.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 10 :</strong></p>
<p>There are reports of strange things in the DarkMarket &#8220;Pandora&#8221;, one of the new DarkMarkets that have bloomed lately.</p>
<p>See more here :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1tq31z/pandora_scammers_beware/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1tq31z/pandora_scammers_beware/</a></p>
<p>Fake Well Known Vendor Accounts, well that could be the usual fake Vendor identity scam.</p>
<p>But some reports also some strange moves on the listings, listings with enormous absurd prices created and then cancelled.</p>
<p>Reminds you something no?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the bet that if nothing is done &#8220;Pandora&#8221; will be closing surprisingly in the next days, with a statement that they have been hacked, or just disappearing like TM.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it is the same guy, as the account name is the one of a well known SR, TM, SM Seller, &#8220;FelixUK&#8221;, nothing proves that it is the real Vendor anyway, but for sure he was doing the very same things we were talking about in this thread.</p>
<p>Putting his listings at absurd prices of thousands of $ on a increasing scale&#8230;. Hum I don&#8217;t know, but if it is confirmed it smells bad for &#8220;Pandora&#8221;.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 11 :</strong></p>
<p>Continuing the hunt on the &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; tracks i have found a bitcoin address he used in the past on the Hackforums.net.</p>
<p>Basically he sold some Bitcoins to a guy for a Paypal transaction and claim he never received the Paypal paiement and linked the conversation to proove he was scammed.</p>
<p>We have so the Bitcoin address of the supposed scammer who received the Bitcoins from &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; meaning Blockchain should be able to give us the original Bitcoin address &#8220;Profesorhouse&#8221; was using.</p>
<p>The supposed scammer bitcoin address is :</p>
<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/en/address/1861Dmf1mRxP6P8ddSzq7ehfrSVxxuZisb" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/en/address/1861Dmf1mRxP6P8ddSzq7ehfrSVxxuZisb</a></p>
<p>On the blockchain it has received the bitcoins at the same date of the supposed scam from the address :</p>
<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/en/address/1Hj45nrcQf1fP8n6KUWXbGDfmW12u5hgCQ" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/en/address/1Hj45nrcQf1fP8n6KUWXbGDfmW12u5hgCQ</a></p>
<p>So we can suppose this address have been used by &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a bitcoin expert, I tried to follow a few transactions coming from and going to this address but the funds are tumbled for sure at some moments with use of one time only bitcoin addresses, and i&#8217;m not sure of the meaning of the wallets i end on following the transactions.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 12 :</strong></p>
<p>FUCCCCKKKKKKK I&#8217;VE FOUND SOMETHING BIG HERE</p>
<p>Looking at the bitcoin address i have given before there is 2 strange transactions, both for a fair amount of bitcoins (5 BTC) coming on the address from big wallets with hundreds of bitcoins.</p>
<p>When you follow these wallets you go on a track on heavy tumbling.</p>
<p>Big packets of 500 BTCs are tumbled through one time addresses, each time a small amount of bitcoin go into a mixer and the funds continue to a whole new address.</p>
<p>Heavy heavy tumbling, hundreds of bounces but it comes from packets of 500 BTC originally.</p>
<p>Making the thing short after you follow all the bounces you get to the original bitcoin address who sent the 500 BTC.</p>
<p>Here it is one of them</p>
<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/en/address/11mbAcNgTixVUUvfGMR2e8uyhLdvwXK42" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/en/address/11mbAcNgTixVUUvfGMR2e8uyhLdvwXK42</a></p>
<p>Now what alimented this address, of course another one bitcoin address, throught 5 x 100 BTC</p>
<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/en/address/1D55bWMJeqZTVKACpcZMFjEYfTaqg5jt2E" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/en/address/1D55bWMJeqZTVKACpcZMFjEYfTaqg5jt2E</a></p>
<p>You want to know how many bitcoins transitted by this address? 5600 BTC exactly&#8230;.FUCKING SHIT&#8230;.THE EXACT AMOUNT OF BITCOINS STOLEN TO SM&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>I have followed the tracks not from SM transactions but from &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; adress on the Hackforums.net&#8230;and now i get to the fucking 5600 BTC stolen to SM? FUCKING SHIT THIS IS BIG NOW&#8230;.</p>
<p>Look also on the Blockchain dates, it matches the dates of the SM hack&#8230;</p>
<p>This means our &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; user on Hackforums.net have received a fair amount of 10 bitcoin in a wallet he have used in the past for transactions with Hackforums.net users, coming from the funds stolen to SM and after the Tumbling of the funds&#8230;.Holly shit if it is not a consistent proof i don&#8217;t know what can be a consistent proof.</p>
<p>I think it is now time some people jump in this thing with me, perhaps help to Doxx him or something seriously, even if they weren&#8217;t robbed in the SM hack there is a fucking 5600 BTC Bounty to this hunt&#8230;..</p>
<p>5600 BTC and the guy know probably very well where they are and how to access to them&#8230;.</p>
<p>Let the fucking Hunt begin!!!!!</p>
<p>Everybody who can do something please jump in this, i came to the limits of my competencies, i&#8217;m not a hacker, not a bitcoin specialist, just a simple user, i know that there are people out there that have mean to get more informations, IP addresses, various informations about his RL identity, please ACT.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 13 :</strong></p>
<p>He definitely has made some mistakes, after the hack, it seems he needed a little bit of money and he transfered 10 BTC from 2 adresses that were tumbling the SM funds.</p>
<p>He direclty tranfered them to what seems to be a exchange place</p>
<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/en/address/1Hj45nrcQf1fP8n6KUWXbGDfmW12u5hgCQ" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/en/address/1Hj45nrcQf1fP8n6KUWXbGDfmW12u5hgCQ</a></p>
<p>Still looking the 5 BTC transaction and where they are going, you arrive directly in what seems to be accounts of a BTC exchange, meaning he has probably left tracks of his RL identity there too.</p>
<p>The few bitcoins he took, compare to the big amount still hided were sent to the Btc exchange and cashed out probably.</p>
<p>That does not indicate if all the money was changed or not but i bet he didn&#8217;t, he cashed out a small amount (at the actual rate 10 BTC is some money) and left all the rest to be tumbled and stocked so he could cash out later.</p>
<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/en/address/1KQiSvSjFZix7SMdTNLtsGhdwv8qi7eddc" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/en/address/1KQiSvSjFZix7SMdTNLtsGhdwv8qi7eddc</a></p>
<p>Here is the address of his account in a BTC exchange i can&#8217;t identify, you can see that it is a BTC exchange with the activity of the addresses linked to this one.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 14 :</strong></p>
<p>He definitely have done some mistakes in how he managed to wash the bitcoins, that can lead to his identity for experienced users.</p>
<p>He probably wanted to get a little bit of money of the hack, and before he put all the bitcoins in sleep after tumbling, he decided to take only a tiny share of the bitcoins stolen, just enough to have fun i guess (around 10000$).</p>
<p>It reminds me the old rules of &#8220;Hold-Up&#8221; when you succeed to steal an enormous amount of money, &#8220;stay low, don&#8217;t buy anything unusual, stay silent, the slightest detail can lead you to be arrested&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyway he transferred these 10 BTC out in the middle of the process of tumbling, to a wallet he had used in the past for transactions on hackforums.net, and then to his usual exchange.</p>
<p>The 2 transactions are issued at two different times from 2 different packets of 500 BTC in tumbling, coming from the original wallet of 5600 BTC and only 1 Transaction out is issued one day later. This can&#8217;t be a coincidence.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 15 :</strong></p>
<p>Damn so much time needed to justify everything, it is exhausting&#8230;</p>
<p>Some peope have questioned the legitimacy of the Bitcoin address i use and its link to &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221;</p>
<p>You can find the original conversation between &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; and his alleged scammer here :</p>
<p>You can see here the bitcoin address the scammer gave to &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; for the change of 1 BTC. When you look at this address you can see where the 1BTC was coming from, the &#8220;profesorhouse&#8221; wallet.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Obviously there are a lot of details that are now pointing at this vendor, i don&#8217;t want to call revenge my self as the OP of all this but i hope people will try to go further in that thing and eventually to the bottom of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;PROFESORHOUSE&#8221;</p>
<p>Any person who have made in the past transactions with this Vendor please speak, any person that remember details about the Vendor i haven&#8217;t writen, anything.</p>
<p>IF ALL THIS IS RIGHT THIS FU..ING SCU..AG SH.T HAS RIPPED A LOT OF COINS, MILLIONS OUT OF ALL THE COMMUNITY,THAT WAS FORMED SINCE SILKROAD, VENDORS, BUYERS, SITE OWNERS, ADMINS, MODS AND PERHAPS MORE THAN WE HAVE EVOQUED.</p>
<p>ANYBODY HAVING MORE INFORMATION PLEASE SPEAK. ANYBODY THAT COULD ACT TO HAVE FURTHER IFORMATION ON HIM DELIVERED TO THE COMMUNITY WILL BE PROBABLY MORE THAN THANKED. IF WE COUNT ONLY THE SM BITCOINS IT IS MORE THAN 5M$ THAT WAS ROBBED IF THE ALLEGED HACK HAPPENS TO BE TRUE.</p>
<p>PLEASE GO TO THIS POST TO GIVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HIM :</p>
