<p>The idea of being a bachelor isn&#8217;t half as good as it sounds.</p>
<p>Sure, conceptually you are not tied down and are free to roam the streets partying or just about doing pretty much anything you want. But that is not really what&#8217;s in it for you, you are more likely to be camping the couch with chips and DVDs if you are single today.</p>
