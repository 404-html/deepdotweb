<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">update</span>: Site is back up &#8211; We are happy that this was a false alarm! Be safe.</span></h2>
<p>I get the feeling that we are going to have to keep this image around:</p>
<div id="attachment_2875" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/imgs/2013/12/gone.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2875" alt="We really wanted to report something about this case - but this is the only info" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gone.jpg" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gone.jpg 480w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gone-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We really wanted to report something about this case &#8211; but this is the only info</p></div>
<p>We had some reports about Pandora market being down, both site and forum &#8211; probably again, &#8220;take the money and run&#8221; type of scam, we will follow and update if needed. it wont be a big surprise if it just stays that way.</p>
<p>We had few people mailing us, one comment left, we there was also a few people reporting about this in Reddit and in SR2 forums. Hopefully this will turn out to be false alarm.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lets make this clear: Most of the (Tor) Deepweb Marketplaces turn out to be scam sites eventually – Silk Road1  &amp; BMR  – were exceptions, people know that and try to take advantage of that – as it became well known that there is a lot of money to be made with scam markets – <span style="color: #ff0000;">so use your common sense!</span></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized future.</p>
