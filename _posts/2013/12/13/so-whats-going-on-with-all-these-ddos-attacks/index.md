<p>There are some big question behind these recent attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this a war between the new markets?  (been suggested its between Silk Road and Tormarket)* Is the the I2P markets trying to prove the vulnerabilities of the .onion markets? (TheMarketplace)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is it the FBI way to try and launch an attack with the intent for crippling and revealing the hosting location of the onion markets? (<a href="http://www.onion-router.net/Publications/locating-hidden-servers.pdf">A DDoS attack is one way to help located &#8216;hidden&#8217; Tor servers)<br/>
</a></li>
<li>Is it again, like it was before in the old SR an attempt to extort the site owners?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Its Also been suggested by some users basing on some posts from DRP that the attack  its launched by the closing BMR staff against the other markets:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/imgs/2013/12/BMR-ddos.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2523" alt="BMR-ddos" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BMR-ddos.jpg" width="765" height="208" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BMR-ddos.jpg 1180w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BMR-ddos-300x82.jpg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BMR-ddos-1024x279.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px"/></a></p>
<p>Many questions without any answers at this point, We will be following this,  We would love to hear your opinion if you can shed some light about this story as this attack seems pretty big with suspicious timing and targets, which make us think its a part of the ongoing attempts to provoke distrust among the darknet users toward the different marketplaces &#8211; its hard to tell at this point if the other two markets (Agora and BlueSkies) are unaffected by these recent attacks or that they are just two small so we will know about that.</p>
<p>One thing for sure is that the problem of one market can make a rather large profit for the other. (ahm ahm&#8230;)</p>
