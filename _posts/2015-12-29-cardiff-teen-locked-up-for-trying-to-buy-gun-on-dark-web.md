<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-35164237">A 17-year-old teen in Cardiff has been sentenced to 12 months of juvenile prison for trying to buy a Glock handgun from a dark net vendor residing in the United States.</a> In addition to that, when the NCA raided his house where the 17-year-old lived, law enforcement authorities found evidence on the computer, which showed that he was involved in a DDoS attack that led to the shutdown of some web pages.</p>
<p>The teenager admitted the attempt to import a firearm along other offences (such as the DDoS) under the Computer Misuse Act. The sentence of the 17-year-old which was given by the Cardiff Youth Court on December 22 was: 12-months in a young offenders&#8217; institution and forced to pay £1,000 in the form of reparations to the victim of the DDoS attack.</p>
<p>Colin Williams, operations manager of the NCA in Wales made this statement regarding the case:</p>
<p>&#8220;The dark net provides criminals with a false sense of security. Some believe they are anonymous online and can act with impunity, whether they operate on the hidden or open internet.&#8221;</p>
