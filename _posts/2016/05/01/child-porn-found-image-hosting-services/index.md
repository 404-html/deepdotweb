    <p>According to a <a href="https://www.iwf.org.uk/assets/media/annual-reports/IWF%202015%20Annual%20Report%20Final%20for%20web.pdf">new report</a> from the United Kingdom based <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3683295/What-is-the-Internet-Watch-Foundation.html">Internet Watch Foundation</a>, most of the child pornography material could be found <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/311726/where-child-porn-lives-online/">hidden away on image hosting websites</a>, mostly located in the United States. Vocativ made this statement in their article about the Internet Watch Foundation’s work:</p>
    <p>”The IWF, a non-profit largely funded by the European Union and online companies, including internet service providers, social networks, and trade organizations, runs a hotline for reports of suspected child porn and employs analysts that seek this stuff out. They then notify law enforcement and, at least for content hosted in the U.K., issue takedown requests.”</p>
    <p>IWF’s report shows pretty interesting metrics. For example, by the country where child porn is hosted, the USA is the first with 57 percent, then comes Europe behind with 41 percent and other countries with the remaining. This information shows that the data is actually hosted on physical servers, not necessarily where the images were created.</p>
    <p>According to the report, most of the material is hosted on websites where admins let users to freely upload content. Metrics from 2015 shows that IWF found 53,218 child porn URLs on image hosting sites. Cyberlockers were the second biggest category with 6965 domains. Cyberlockers are password protected file hosting services. The two are followed by banner websites and social networking sites, web archives, and redirectors, domains forwarding visitors from one URL to a different one with under 1,000 cases each.</p>
    <p>The report also shows a huge rise in child pornography. According to the researchers, there has been an increase by 417 percent in minor sexual abuse since 2013, however, those were just cases where child pornography was suspected. Last year, 68,092 cases were confirmed as online child porn, which is an 118 percent increase from 2014. The report may show bigger figures at 2015 since the group only began working actively on the case from last year.</p>
    <p>The researchers only found just 51 websites hosting child porn material within proxy networks (including the dark web) in 2014, compared to 79 in 2015.</p>
