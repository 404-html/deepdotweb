    <p>Security Researchers at Forcepoint discovered that a Russian hacking forum on the dark web is <a href="http://www.scmagazineuk.com/cerber-ransomware-on-sale-in-russian-darknet-with-new-scripting-features/article/498069/">selling the Cerber ransomware as a RaaS</a> (Ransom-as-a-service). This is a new form since Cerber has been distributed via exploit kits or email using macro-enabled Word document files, however, this is the first time WSFs (Windows Script Files) have been used for this purpose.</p>
    <p>WSFs are executable with the Windows wscript.exe utility and can contain scripts from any Windows Script compatible scripting engine in a single file. After successful execution of the file, the Cerber crypto-ransomware will be downloaded on the victim&#8217;s system.</p>
    <p>The hackers are making the victims download Cerber in two methods; first is a double-zipped file with a WSF inside attached to the malicious email and the other is an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of the message, which is also linking to the same ZIP file.</p>
    <p>Since the nature (invoice -related subject line, genuine-looking content, and an unsubscribe link) of the double-zipped file with the WSF, heuristics-reliant security solutions might be bypassed due to the uncommon use of the WSF.</p>
    <p>Cerber has the encryption capability without communicating with associated command and control (C&amp;C) servers, however, security researcher at Forcepoint Nicholas Griffin wrote that Forcepoint had discovered weaknesses in the encryption implementation, which could be used to partially decrypt the files. He also made this statement:</p>
    <p>“Although the number of observed victims is low, the majority currently appear to be within the UK.  However, this is likely to change over time.”</p>
