    <p><strong>BITCOIN DEVELOPMENT:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Opinion Divided on Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity as Australian Craig Wright </strong></p>
    <p>In the span of one week, the identity of bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto was revealed, dragged through the mud and revoked. Cryptographer Craig Wright, provided proof behind closed doors to the BBC, Economist, and GQ in London, by digitally signing transactions of addresses from Block 9, one of the early blocks. In attendance was Garvin Andresen and Jon Matonis; both subsequently published blog posts affirming Craig’s claim.</p>
    <p>The Bitcoin community lashed out at Craig in response to his claims, declaring only keys to the genesis block would suffice as proof, despite the possibility that keys could have been hacked, or shared or moved. Craig Wright responded with an apology letter, announcing he would not offer any more proof and would quietly retire from the public limelight.</p>
