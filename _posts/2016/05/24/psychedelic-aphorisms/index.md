    <p>DeepDotWeb&#8217;s in-house shaman would like to share with you some of his thoughts:</p>
    <p>BEGINNING OF THE FIRST INSTALLMENT</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>We may call him “Custer.”</p>
    <p>The angry little fellow on the hill, making his last stand against the raging whirling walls of colour, closing in on every side.</p>
    <p>He puts up resistance, does what damage he can, and then he, too, is swallowed and swept away – or else remains, and poisons all that follows.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>When under its spell, the mind overwhelms the self by drowning it in gifts.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>Like a kitten in spring. “So much to do! So many birds and scents and mice and winds to sniff and chase and follow!”</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>Pearlhunting in a thunderstorm.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>… And the song became a sleigh-ride through a frosty winter landscape.</p>
    <p>The bass drum became the smattering of the wolf-dogs’ feet; the cymbal the crack of my whip as I urged them on; and the snare the beckoning drum of the god ahead.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>Two hands, grotesquely disproportioned – the left hand a weak little stump of withered meat, the right a monstrous claw of steel, tearing the bark as he storms along its trunk.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>A tattoo of the tree in one&#8217;s chest.</p>
    <p>Its roots below all earths, its crown above all heavens.</p>
    <p>From each green and golden leaf, “dew drips down into the dale below,” where the people have gathered together, to drink and to bathe in its waters.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>The god happened.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>… That the gods yet sleep and hunt in hiding, woven into the knotwork of the mind…</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>… A feast with green, green grapes – “and crispy strips of bacon!”</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>“Lost no more to time and place, / for I have seen the land / I have heard the Valkyrie sing / and I’ve touched Odin’s hand.”</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>The cymbal is the whip and the slap and the thunderbolt of the god.</p>
    <p>It warns us, too, against the madness of the seven colours, and reminds us of our final duty – to return home, at the end of every hunt.</p>
    <p>For “to return empty-handed is a sin – but not to return at all is an abomination.”</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>Coming home, at long last, with four rabbits and a deer, slung over a bloody shoulder.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>Oh these things which will not melt.</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>“Let us make new masks, then, if these old ones no longer fit us.”</p>
    <p>*        *        *</p>
    <p>END OF THE FIRST INSTALLMENT</p>
