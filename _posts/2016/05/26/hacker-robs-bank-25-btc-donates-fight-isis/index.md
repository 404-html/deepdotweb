    <p>A hacker known only as <a href="https://twitter.com/GammaGroupPR/status/728230300241760256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Phineas Fisher tweeted</a> about his recent donation of 25 bitcoins to a crowdfunding account set up by members of the Rojava region in Syria. Fisher described this cause as one of the most inspirational revolutionary projects in the world today.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hack.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14237" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hack.png" alt="hack" width="786" height="278" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hack.png 786w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hack-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px"/></a></p>
    <p>Fisher has said that the bitcoin donation, which by the way is listed publicly on the blockchain ledger, came from him hacking into a bank.</p>
    <p>“The money did come from robbing a bank. Bank robbing is more viable than ever. It’s just done differently these days,” Fisher wrote in a post on Reddit.</p>
    <p>Ars Technica was lucky enough to have the opportunity to interview the hacker, at which time he declined to give more information about which bank he robbed, but did say he planned on making more, and larger donations in the near future.</p>
    <p>“There’s hopefully a few orders of magnitude on the way.”</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/robin-hood-hacker-donates-stolen-bitcoin-help-fight-isis-461245">Phineas Fisher not only gives</a>, he takes as well. He has claimed responsibility for attacking and hacking a company that sells spying tools to governments. Hacking Team was breached in 2015. As a result, over 400GB of highly sensitive data was dumped about its clients as well as its operations.</p>
    <p>A “DIY Guide to Hacking” was published by Fisher; post hack, explaining his motives for attacking Hacking Team. Included in this manual were tips on how to avoid being caught while hacking as well.</p>
    <p>“Hacker culture was born in the U.S. as a counterculture, but that origin only remains in its aesthetics-the rest has been assimilated,” Fishers guide read. “At least they can wear a t-shirt, dye their hair blue, use their hacker names, and feel like rebels while they work for the Man. You used to have to sneak into offices to leak documents. You used to need a gun to rob a bank. Now you can do both from bed with a laptop in your hand.”</p>
    <p>Officially named ‘Rojava Plan’, were not able to comment on the situation, but the crowdfunding account page did say that the donation will go to “feeding the revolution” after crucial imports were cut off because of the fight with ISIS.</p>
    <p>Reddit patrons were singing Fisher with praises, calling him a hero for his actions and even said they want to see more robbing from banks and giving it to good causes.</p>
    <p>“Unfortunately, our world is backwards, you get rich by doing bad things, and go to jail for doing good,” his guide went on. “Leaking documents, expropriating money from banks, and working to secure computers for ordinary people is ethical hacking. However, most people call themselves ethical hackers just work to secure those who pay their high consulting fees, who are often the most deserving to be hacked.”</p>
