    <p>At the Inside Dark Web conference in New York City Thursday, an attorney who works for the U.S. Army and the CIA discussed plans to<a href="http://www.scmagazine.com/legal-effects-of-encryption-bills-discussed-at-dark-web-event/article/496158/"> regulate encryption technologies</a>.</p>
    <p>“State legislative response may be un-Constitutional, because it would place a burden on interstate commerce,” Alexander Urbelis, who works at Blackstone Law Group said. “So they may, in fact, be a way to encourage the federal government to enact encryption legislation.”</p>
    <p>California, Louisiana, and New York have all introduced some kind of encryption legislation recently.</p>
    <p>California&#8217;s proposed “Assembly 1681,” would have made phone manufacturers and operating system providers pay a $2,500 for not obeying court orders to decrypt phones. <a href="http://www.scmagazine.com/lawmakers-shoot-down-california-smartphone-decryption-bill/article/489603/%20/">This bill was voted against </a>last month however. New York currently has a <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/a8093">similar bill proposition</a> that is currently still in the committee.</p>
    <p>“The economic implications would outstrip the privacy implications,” Urbelis noted while talking about the effects of the bill sponsored by Feinstein and Burr. “<a href="http://www.scmagazine.com/encryption-bill-draft-muddled-imposing/article/488780/%20/">The economic implications </a>of these legislation have not been fully thought through. They are obviously going to become very attractive targets for hackers, and other criminal groups.”</p>
    <p>Urbelis is the head of Black Chambers; which is an information security firm that protects legal privilege.</p>
    <p>“<a href="http://www.scmagazine.com/will-the-panama-papers-change-legal-firms-cyber-practices/article/487488/%20/">Many law firms have lost confidence of clients to protect their data. Law firms have been for a long time the soft underbelly of their clients</a>,” he said.</p>
