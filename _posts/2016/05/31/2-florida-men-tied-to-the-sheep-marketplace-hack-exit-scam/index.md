    <p class="p1"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/05/30/mystery-solved-6-6-million-bitcoin-theft-that-brought-down-dark-web-site-tied-to-2-florida-men/#1305c68253bb">According to Forbes</a>, The U.S. government has seized $4.5 million from two Florida men who allegedly stole 5,400 bitcoins from illegal online drug sales site Sheep Marketplace in late 2013, shortly before the price of bitcoin hit its peak of around $1,200, according to forfeiture documents filed last week in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
    <p class="p3">The money was forfeited back in the spring of 2014, along with a 2012 Toyota Camry and a 2008 Honda motorcycle, by Nathan Gibson and Sean Mackert, who are both 24, but were 21 at the time of the heist.</p>
    <p>This is the civil forfeiture complaint of one of them, Sean Mackert detailing how they got caught when their ID where linked to their IP&#8217;s, Coinbase &amp; Bank accounts :</p>

    <p>For those of you who don&#8217;t remember, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_Marketplace">Sheep marketplace</a>, was an anonymous marketplace set up as a Tor hidden service. It launched in March 2013 and was one of the lesser known sites to gain popularity with the well publicized closure of the Silk Road marketplace later that year. It ceased operation in December 2013, when it announced it was shutting down after a vendor stole $6 million worth of users&#8217; bitcoins.</p>
    <p>Following that alleged hack, the site owner then proceeded to disable all bitcoin withdrawals from the site by telling some lie about a bitcoin mixer implementation which went wrong, and disabling all forum posting:</p>

    <p>The owner even went as far implementing a fake counter telling the users they must deposit at least 1BTC to be able to withdraw one the counter hit &#8220;0&#8221;</p>

    <p>Shortly after that, the site was taken down completely along with all the remaining bitcoin, the site owner identity was later revealed as a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/sheep-marketplace-and-tomas-jirikovsky/">Czech guy named Tomas</a>, Who <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/27/breaking-sheep-marketplace-owner-arrested/">got arrested last year</a> while trying to launder some of the stolen funds after he bought a luxury house.</p>

    <p>So yeah, well at least now we know who Ebook101 was, but this was still the first major exit scam.</p>
