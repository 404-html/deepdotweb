    <p>During a check performed by customs at Frankfurt Airport. Agents randomly selected the package for inspection when a quarter kilo of amphetamines were found inside. Authorities stated the <a href="http://ooe.orf.at/news/stories/2808986/">24-year-old Austrian man was a regular user of the Dark Net.</a></p>
    <p>Authorities said it was by chance only that his package was selected for inspection at the Airport Frankfurt AM Main in Germany. Once discovered, the German Customs agents alerted Austrian authorities. The Wels Public prosecutor ordered a search of the man’s home.</p>
    <p>Authorities also said for over a year the Bad Ischl resident ordered drugs from Dark Net Markets. The man admitted to sourcing drugs from the Dark Net, and also that he re-sold the drugs he purchased. The man was also found in possession of one Marijuana plant.</p>
    <p>When authorities conducted the search, they found the small pot grow, small amounts of cocaine, as well as speed paste. Not only were drugs seized, but also packaging material and over 3,000 euros in small denominations. Also taken were a gas pistol, and an illegal electro-stool. Upon questioning, the man admitted to everything and then was placed under arrest.</p>
    <p>That’s not where the man stopped talking though. He also dimed his fellow conspirators out, so four more accused were investigated. Upon their investigation, authorities concluded that another four men were also a part of the Dark Net drug ring. Even further, all of the men were found to be in possession of 12 more pot plants, and what law enforcement called a “<strong><em>breeding facility</em></strong>”. All parties were remanded into custody, and are awaiting bond hearings.</p>

    <p>This isn’t the first-time Frankfurt Customs has had to deal with drug packages coming into the facility, or even the airport itself. Back in March, a 24-year-old Columbian woman was found to be attempting to smuggle cocaine into the country with her breast implants. Attempted drugs smuggled in by package, and person have climbed at an alarming rate for Frankfurt Customs agents.</p>
    <p>The agency explained they have such a big battlefield to defend, and most, if not all of the drug packages are hidden so well, not even machines and dogs are able to find them. Therefore, most of the packages containing drugs move right through like any other package; because it looks like just that; any other package.</p>
    <p>Dark Net Customers value the stealth of their shipments immensely, second to only quality in some cases. That being said, Vendors often strive for the best possible stealth for all packages, but as Customs departments all over the world become more advanced, and figure out new ways to sniff out these drug shipments, Vendors stealth will also continue to increase. There seems to be no signs of shipments stopping, or even slowing anytime soon.</p>
    <p>Vendors often pay attention to who has been busted recently, and how it was packaged. Most of this information can be sought out online, and on the DNMs themselves. It seems like a never ending game of cat and mouse; with the prize being either avoiding a lengthy stay in jail, or handing out such a sentence.</p>
