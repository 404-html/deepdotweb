    <p>DEA agents conducted undercover buys from a darknet vendor between 2015 and 2016. That vendor, after sitting in jail for months, pleaded guilty on October 27. In a Broward County courthouse, Chrissano Leslie aka “owlcity” admitted to selling heroin and fentanyl on the DNMs. He pleaded guilty to all charges of drug-dealing, money-laundering conspiracy, and aggravated identity theft.</p>
    <p>In addition to heroin and fentanyl, Leslie sold α-PVP. The state of Florida has had issues with widespread α-PVP use; according to mainstream media, Florida has dealt with more α-PVP abuse than many states combined. Sources of the drug, both online and at a street level, became a high priority for Florida law enforcement.</p>
    <p>Leslie landed on the DEA’s radar after the U.S. Postal Service intercepted several of his outgoing packages. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) notified the DEA after discovering the presence of α-PVP and fentanyl. Several public service <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/23/pill-counterfeiting-lab-bust-dea-warns-fentanyls-danger/">warnings regarding Fentanyl</a> have been made by the DEA where they promised to end fentanyl trafficking.</p>
    <p>After USPS intercepted a package, DEA agents waited for someone to check the tracking number. The tracking status was accessed by an IP address linked to Leslie&#8217;s home in Miramar, prosecutors wrote in court records.</p>
    <p>Leslie’s Alphabay profile listed his policy on tracking numbers: “Tracking available on all orders. In case a package doesnt arrive (which is rare) I will reship.”</p>
    <p>The DEA, through an undisclosed method, linked Chrissano Leslie to the vendor profile “owlcity.” Courts documents revealed that Leslie sold on Agora Marketplace, the Abraxas Marketplace and Alphabay Market. Prosecutors wrote that the drugs he sold varied from market-to-market but mostly sold anti-anxiety pills, cocaine, fentanyl, heroin, and α-PVP.</p>
    <p>“great communication, great product, great vender. Order with confidence,” a customer wrote in reference to Leslie’s α-PVP.</p>

    <p>In one online listing that offered heroin, Leslie wrote: &#8220;Finally Ive gotten some very good dope which ive tested myself,&#8221; court documents revealed.</p>
    <p>DEA agents placed an order from owlcity in March 2016. The agents, with help from Miramar police, tailed him to a post office where he shipped the agents’ order. He shipped four additional packages to non-DEA customers at the same time.</p>
    <p>Agents noticed no activity during a period of time in July and they discovered Leslie was having his laptop repaired. Prosecutors wrote that this is when the DEA wanted to move in. On July 27, law enforcement raided the man’s home and arrested him as he was attempting to flush the drugs he possessed. Drugs, “bitcoin storage devices,” and computers were discovered, according to the prosecutors.</p>

    <p>Forensic analysis of Leslie’s computers paired with data on his vendor accounts revealed that he conducted 1,000+ transactions.</p>
    <p>Robert Trachman, Leslie&#8217;s lawyer, he had no comment. Leslie has been incarcerated since his July arrest. Leslie is set to be sentenced next year and faces a possible maximum prison term of 52 years.</p>
