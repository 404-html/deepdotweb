    <p>As early as spring 2016, the narcotic taskforce of the Steyr police were on the trail of a suspected drug dealer. Police intercepted a package of drugs from Germany that was en route to the 45-year-old darknet vendor. The vendor has now been arrested after a lengthy investigation by the SPK.</p>
    <p>One of the case investigators explained that the accused vendor was not initially suspected of distributing via the darknet. Packages of drugs were mailed to the man for resale, but often were delivered in person. The initial interception was a package that was to be physically trafficked into Austria by car. Details remain scarce but the arrest of the driver resulted in the investigation of the 45-year-old, previously innocent man.</p>
    <p>Detectives had little evidence to rely on until an inbound package, addressed to the suspect’s apartment, was seized. The package contained a significant quantity of drugs, confirming again the man was a dealer.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16277 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/11/drugs-jpg.jpeg" alt="drugs.jpg" srcset="/imgs/2016/11/drugs-jpg.jpeg 561w, /imgs/2016/11/drugs-jpg-300x168.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></p>
    <p>Case investigators then detected incoming packages from Germany and Holland. Again, the quantity of drugs in each package was of a “wholesale” level. Every package noted or intercepted by police came from Germany or Holland. The police, however, did not intercept every package addressed to the suspect. A full case was needed and law enforcement did not want to arouse suspicion.</p>
    <p>Finally, a package was intercepted that gave investigators insight into the suspect’s deepweb activities. The mail presented a so-called “gap” in the network, revealing both the supplier and the main suspect’s online identities.</p>
    <p>Cybercrime investigators located the man’s vendor account on numerous marketplaces. They discovered the vendor specialized in amphetamines, ecstasy, mushrooms, and crystal meth. He presented himself as a reliable source from Austria, one report claimed.</p>
    <p>His outgoing packages, when possible, were scrutinized. However, many packages were not intercepted in an effort to keep the case low-profile. The packages that did get picked up by police revealed key details regarding the vendor’s style and stealth. Drug-containing mail was camouflaged well, often with a CD or DVD case to disguise the drugs. Some of the drugs were shipped in letters disguised as “securities broadcasts,” another source said.</p>
    <p>Enough evidence was collected to make any charges stick and law enforcement finally moved in. A raid of the suspect’s apartment was conducted, yielding an enormous amount of evidence for the prosecution.</p>
    <p>Police discovered numerous computers in the raided apartment, evidence that the suspect was an amphetamine user, and handwritten customer data.</p>
    <p>Forensic teams crawled through the data on the vendor’s machines. More than 350 customers were identified and a total of 400+ sales were recorded. &#8220;70 to 80 percent of the buyers are domestic,&#8221; said one of the investigators. The suspect made &#8220;several thousand euros per month,&#8221; an investigator wrote.</p>
    <p>The man was arrested and currently sits in the prison of Garsten, awaiting formal sentencing. The seriousness of such an extensive drug trade led to the threatening of a 15-year prison sentence, a source said. The suspect made a full confession but investigators have not made a final decision. &#8220;We currently scour his accounting,&#8221; said Alfred Krendelsberger of the Steyr narcotic group.</p>
