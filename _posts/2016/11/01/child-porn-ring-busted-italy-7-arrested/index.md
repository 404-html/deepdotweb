    <p>A <a href="http://lapresse.it/pedopornografia-smantellata-organizzazione-criminale-7-arresti.html">joint action</a> between District Anti-Mafia Directorate of the Public Prosecutor of Rome and the Europol European Cybercrime Center resulted in the arrest of seven suspects who are believed to be a part of a major dark net child porn community.</p>
    <p>This is the first time in Italy where internet pedophiles have been busted. The suspects are charged with the association for transnational conspiracy aimed at committing crimes of pedophilia and child pornography. In addition to that, Italian law enforcement authorities provided information on numerous potential child victims of sexual abuse and abduction.</p>
    <p>The FBI and the Queensland local police have also participated in the action since there were connections between the arrested Italian suspects and Australian pedo king Shannon Grant McCoole and his Danish and Dutch helpers.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/08/11/australian-darkweb-pedo-site-admin-sentenced-to-35-years-in-jail/">Shannon McCoole</a> was the admin of “The Love Zone” (TLZ) dark net child porn website, which had an estimated number of 47,000 users. The Australian family worker not only ran the pedo site, but he had committed other horrific crimes including the rape of children under his care. His victims included a child as young as 18-months-old and other victims who had autism or were disabled. McCoole was known in the dark net pedophile community as “skee” and posted messages on his site like these:</p>
    <p>”TLZ is a living creature,” the post on the main site goes by. “We have survived a lot of ups and downs. Its been a passion of mine for a long time, and TLZ is bigger than ever. In the past we have taken a Christmas break on our contributions, because at this time of year a lot of people are away and can’t get onto the site safely, but that break doesn’t give the admin team time off.”</p>
    <p>“Believe it or not the board doesn’t run itself and requires a lot of thankless hours from all the Admins, Co admins and mods. So the board will go into maintenance mode till the new year to give the admin team time to take a break. I’ll leave this a few days so that you people can see the message.”</p>
    <p>“TLZ will return in 2015 refreshed and better than ever. For those that want to chat and do some basic trading Newcummers will remain open, and thats where you will find me.”</p>
    <p>McCoole’s profile on TLZ listed his current occupation and described himself as a “professional photographic sex instructor”. His interests in children included “anything below 12”, and under his hobby, he wrote “Sex, sex, sex, more sex, natural weight loss for chubby kids”.</p>
    <p>Shannon Grant McCoole was sentenced by South Australian Court to 35 years in prison with a 28 years non-parole period in August 2015. This is the maximum time that can be given to sex offenders in Australia.</p>
    <p>“You have no moral compass,” Paul Rice, the judge of the District Court told McCole. “You were excited and sought sexual satisfaction, not just from touching very young children but also having sexual intercourse with infants. What would incline you to do such a thing is far beyond my comprehension. It engenders feelings of outrage and revulsion among right-thinking people.”</p>
