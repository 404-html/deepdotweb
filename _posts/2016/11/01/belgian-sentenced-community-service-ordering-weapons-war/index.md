    <p>A 37-year-old man from Herent, Belgium was sentenced to 80 hours of community service for possessing and ordering weapons of war from the dark net.</p>
    <p>According to court documents, the 37-year-old man had seen the news about the ongoing war in Syria and the possible consequences of it on Belgium. He wanted to protect himself and his family, according to the court ruling. That’s when he decided to order a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a Glock handgun, a silencer and ammo for the weapons from the dark web. He found a US weapon vendor on a dark net market, which he came in contact with. Before the package arrived, Belgian law enforcement authorities were alerted and seized the parcel and arrested the 37-year-old soon after it was delivered to the man’s home address.</p>
    <p>When the Herent man was questioned by law enforcement authorities, he did confess everything and explained why he ordered the weapons from the dark net. After a month of detention, because of the man’s health problems, he was released under strict conditions.</p>
    <p>The weapons the man had ordered and related materials were confiscated by police and will be destroyed.</p>
    <p>It is unclear how Belgian authorities were alerted by the weapons package. One possibility includes that the US dark net vendor was an undercover agent who sent the parcel to the 37-year-old and warned Belgian police. Although, undercover agents don’t usually send lethal weapons in parcels, especially internationally since there is a risk that authorities in the destination country fail to arrest the suspect. Another probability, which has the biggest chance, that the border force in Belgium noticed the suspicious package and alerted other law enforcement authorities in the country to perform a controlled delivery on the suspect. This option has the most chance since there were multiple weapons (and a silencer) and ammunition in the parcel. A metal detector could easily spot a firearm.</p>
    <p>The most recent dark net arrest in Belgium was the bust of a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/07/charleroi-policeman-arrested-buying-explosives-dark-net/">Charleroi policeman</a> who bought weapons and explosives from the dark web. Thomas V., a 35-year-old, who was part of GSA, a security and intelligence group based in Charleroi, was charged with illegally importing weapons and explosives along with two counts of attempted murder. Reports say he was planning to assassinate at least two people and have already received weapon orders from the dark net. When he was arrested, police found numerous weapons at the suspect’s home. Investigators could confirm the assassination plot of at least two people who are believed to be boyfriends of Thomas V.’s ex-girlfriends. The policeman has not been sentenced yet.</p>
    <p>In Germany, where most of the dark net busts happen in Europe, a 41-year-old Berlin man was sentenced to four years in prison for <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/20/darknet-weapons-vendor-gets-four-year-prison-sentence/">illegal arms trafficking</a>. He sold weapons and ammunition on the dark net. Investigators were cracking down online firearm sales in the area and seized a parcel containing a weapon he sent to one of his customers. Soon after that, police bugged the 41-year-old’s vehicle and recorded the vendor talking about the sale of ammunition for firearms. According to the Berlin Regional Court, the man had sold ten weapons in the past six months.</p>
