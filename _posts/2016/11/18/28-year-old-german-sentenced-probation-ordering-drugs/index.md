    <p>A 28-year-old man from Aibling, Germany was <a href="http://www.ovb-online.de/rosenheim/bad-aibling/junkie-wurde-ermittelt-6941159.html">sentenced</a> to 22 months of probation for ordering drugs from the dark web.</p>
    <p>According to police information, the Aibling electrician ordered <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/drugs/">drugs</a> in 16 cases in 2013. The 28-year-old thought he was in complete anonymity when he made the purchases, however, he was among those persons who the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/fbi/">FBI</a> cracked their IP addresses. After the Bureau tracked back the man’s location, they provided information to border forces and local law enforcement authorities in <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/germany/">Germany</a>.</p>
    <p>Since one of the orders of the electrician was of larger quantities, he was also charged with the trafficking of narcotics. The court hearing took place in Rosenheim under the chairmanship of Judge Christian Merkel. Jürgen Liebhart, defending the accused, admitted all but one of his client’s offenses. He claimed that the 28-year-old never sold drugs.</p>
    <p>According to court documents, the electrician is now living a life without using drugs. On the other hand, police claimed they have evidence that the 28-year-old trafficked narcotics, however, the evidence did not stand its place during the trial. Prosecutors stated that they do not believe Liebhart’s statement that the accused did not traffic any drugs. However, since the electrician did not have any criminal record, Judge Merkel sentenced him to 22 months on probation. Before the sentencing, Liebhart declared once again that his client is innocent on the charge of drug trafficking and asked the judge for a suspended punishment.</p>
    <p>Germany has been a hot place for dark net busts in the past few months. One of the most recent cases was a 29-year-old man from Ostprignitz-Ruppin who was arrested for allegedly running a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/30/another-bust-germany-vendor-ostprignitz-ruppin-arrested/">vendor shop</a> on the dark web. The Brandenburg Police Department announced the bust, however, since it was brief, we do not know which vendor shop the suspect was allegedly running. The Prosecutor’s Office in Cottbus said the 29-year-old sold prescription drugs and other narcotics for a year. As in most dark net markets (if not all), payments were made exclusively in bitcoins. According to police information, when law enforcement authorities traced back the transactions of the alleged vendor, they found multiple BTC payments, some of them in the five-figure Euro range.</p>
    <p>The counterfeit prescription drug business is currently <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/10/smuggling-counterfeit-drugs-new-business-germany/">booming</a> in Germany. German news magazine welt.de reported organized criminals saw the opportunity in smuggling fake pharmaceutical pills in the country and are cutting huge profits from the business. The narcotics are produced in underground facilities in Asian countries, such as India, China or Bangladesh, shipped by air to Germany and sold to customers as original pills.</p>
    <p>“Why should I kill myself as a criminal with dangerous drug stores, if the profit margins for counterfeit drugs are much bigger?” criminal law Professor Arndt Sinn, who is currently researching similar cases at the University of Osnabrück asked rhetorically. “From one kilo of raw cocaine worth 1000 euros you can make 45,000 euros, from one kilo of Viagra active ingredient Sildenafil, which is sold for 50 euros, you can easily earn 90,000 euros.”</p>
    <p>The 2015 Customs Press Conference in April revealed that almost four million pills were seized by German customs in 2015, which is four times as many as in 2014.</p>
