    <p>A 25-year-old from Idar-Oberstein was <a href="http://www.focus.de/regional/rheinland-pfalz/kriminalitaet-illegaler-darknet-waffenkaeufe-25-jaehriger-bleibt-in-haft_id_6171453.html">sentenced</a> to prison for ordering two handguns, a grenade, ammunition and a “shooting pen” from a dark net market.</p>
    <p>According to official court information, the accused and his defender had withdrawn their appeal before the regional court in Bad Kreuznach on Monday. The 25-year-old was sentenced to one year and nine months in prison for violating the law on weapons and the war arms control law. He confessed his crimes.</p>
    <p>Ordering weapons from the dark net is a really risky business. Many suspects have been arrested for doing such things. One of the most recent cases from <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/germany/">Germany</a> is a 24-year-old who was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/10/24-year-old-suspect-admits-attempting-purchase-several-firearms-darknet/">busted</a> in September by the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/bka/">BKA</a> (Federal Criminal Police) for trying to buy weapons from the dark net. An undercover BKA agent made a vendor account on a dark web market and arranged a deal with the suspect. They agreed to meet in person near a crowded supermarket where law enforcement authorities intercepted and arrested the man. According to police information, the 24-year-old admitted all charges against him.</p>
    <p>When law enforcement authorities performed a house search on the suspect’s home in Neuburg-Schrobenhausen, they found a marijuana grow-operation, which they called as a “stately drugstore”. Prosecutor’s office states that there were other drugs in the home of the 24-year-old, however, since the lack of information provided by authorities, we can’t confirm any details on this. The suspect admitted to attempting to purchase firearms and ammunition via the dark net and the charge of cultivating of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/cannabis/">cannabis</a>.</p>
    <p>Police kept the public in the dark after the bust had happened. They only mentioned that the 24-year-old was trying to buy a single firearm, the prosecutor’s office did not even say anything about cannabis cultivation. In addition to that, according to official court information, the accused allegedly tried to buy multiple firearms and ammunition from the dark web. The spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office said the investigation is not complete. Statements from the suspect are being reviewed with regard to their plausibility. No further details have been announced.</p>
    <p>Germany is not the only country affected by dark net weapon-related busts. Allen Kennedy, a 30-year-old PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) officer in Belfast was arrested on September 5 for ordering a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/handgun/">handgun</a>, a silencer, and ammunition from the dark web, court documents say. Law enforcement authorities caught the man when he was making the deal personally in Annadale Embankment after handing over £500 for the package. When police searched the PSNI officer’s vehicle, they found <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/cocaine/">cocaine</a> hidden inside drinks tins and WD-40 oil sprays. According to court information, the 30-year-old was involved in a drug dealing operation.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/03/psni-officer-tried-buy-handgun-dark-web/">PSNI officer</a> claimed he bought the gun to commit suicide, however, his claim was rejected. Kennedy is charged with the attempted possession of a handgun, 10 rounds of ammunition and a silencer in suspicious circumstances and with intent to endanger life. He is also accused of possessing bullets, a shotgun cartridge, and Class A drugs with intent to supply and simple possession of cannabis. Kennedy was remanded in custody to appear again by video-link in four weeks.</p>
