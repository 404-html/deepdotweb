    <p>Today we want to show you how to buy bitcoins from your peers without the need to deposit national currencies or provide personal information. We are talking about <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=4v6y" target="_blank">LocalBitcoins</a>, a p2p Bitcoin exchange that allows users to buy and sell from each other for basically every payment method available. This is a prefered exchange among deep web users, since it protects your privacy to a certain degree as it does not require you to provide any personal information or documents. Of course, this method is not infallible as it requires you to reveal your identity to the person selling Bitcoin. You can also sell your btc on LocalBitcoins. LocalBitcoins charges a 1% fee to the user that posts the trade. All other trades are free of charge.</p>
    <p>Let’s get started</p>
    <p><strong>Create an account</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click here to register an account with <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=4v6y" target="_blank">LocalbBitcoins</a>. Click “<strong>Sign up free</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16528 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-png.png" alt="1.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-png.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-png-300x112.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your information and click “<strong>Register</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16529 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2-png-1.png" alt="2.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2-png-1.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2-png-1-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm your email and log in.</p>
    <p><strong>Buy Bitcoin </strong></p>
    <p>Now it’s time to buy some Bitcoin. Ideally, you will want to choose cash in person as it’s the most untraceable way to exchange money. You can also choose to create your own order with your preferred price or to take one that has been previously created by someone. Remember that since users are providing a service in selling you Bitcoin, they will charge a premium on the market price. This premium will change according to the type of payment method, user reputation, and quality of service. Ideally, you’ll want to use your best judgement to make a reasonable choice between price and the type of seller.</p>
    <p>Never try to haggle with the seller or change the terms. It will probably not happen and the seller will not appreciate it.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter the amount <strong>(1)</strong> and currency you want to buy your Bitcoin with <strong>(2)</strong>, the location <strong>(3)</strong>, and the type of payment method <strong>(4)</strong>. We are going to choose cash in hand.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16530 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3-png.png" alt="3.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3-png.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3-png-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “<strong>Search</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16531" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4-png.png" alt="4.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4-png.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4-png-300x46.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select an offer that best fits your needs according to distance, price and seller reputation. Then click “<strong>Buy</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16532 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6-png.png" alt="6.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6-png.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6-png-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p>The seller reputation is described in from of his name. The first number is the number of trades and the % is the number percentage of positive feedback. (In this example, the seller has more than 100 trades with 100% feedback)</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16533" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7-png.png" alt="7.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7-png.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7-png-300x32.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Make sure you read the terms of the trade <strong>(1) </strong>and agree with them before proceeding. Then select the amount of BTC you want to buy <strong>(2)</strong> and click “<strong>Send trade request</strong>” <strong>(3)</strong></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16534 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10-png.png" alt="10.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10-png.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10-png-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p>You will begin a chat with the seller. Follow the seller’s instructions to complete the trade in person. His Bitcoin will remain in escrow until the transaction is complete, after which you can withdraw them to a personal wallet.</p>
    <p><strong>Create an Order</strong></p>
    <p>If you don’t like any of the available orders, you can always create your own. If anyone is interested they will open it and follow your terms. Remember that it may take a very long time for someone to take your order, depending on the price, location and quantity.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click “<strong>Post trade”</strong></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16535 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8-png.png" alt="8.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8-png.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8-png-300x61.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Fill in your preferred settings and click “<strong>Publish advertisement</strong>” at the bottom of the page</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16536 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/9-png.png" alt="9.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/9-png.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/9-png-300x61.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Wait for someone to take your order and chat with that person to agree on a location and time.</p>
    <p>It is far more complicated to create an order than to take one, so make sure you’re prepared to walk the “customer” through the process. If not, you can always just take an order, which is much more simple. Furthermore, trades are free for the one that takes the order, while the poster has to pay a 1% fee.</p>
