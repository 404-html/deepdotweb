    <p>Only 41 percent of American voters oppose marijuana legalization in the United States, according to a recent poll by Quinnipiac University. 54 percent of voters are on board. If you’ve kept up with any marijuana legalization news in the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/29/illinois-decriminalize-small-amounts-marijuana/">past</a> <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/29/italian-parliament-moves-towards-marijuana-legalization/">few</a> months, you’d see this year has been a major turning point worldwide and specifically so in the US. Come November, at least five more states will be voting on the plant’s legalization.</p>
    <p>Currently we have legal medicinal marijuana in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._jurisdiction">overwhelming</a> number of states but it’s only legal recreationally in  Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Colorado. And the District of Columbia of course.</p>
    <p>California, Nevada, Maine, Arizona, and Massachusetts are the states next in line for fully legalized marijuana. Florida, Missouri, and Michigan also deserve a spot on this list although the reforms are still more uncertain than they should be.</p>
    <p>California’s “The Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA)” campaign has gathered enough signatures that it will be on the ballot in November. Possession of a single ounce of bud or four grams of concentrates will be legal for anyone 21+. One would be allowed up to grow six plants at once. A new sale and regulation tax would be put into place on cannabis products.</p>
    <p>Nevada will be seeing marijuana legalization on the ballot in November. Adults would be permitted the possession of an ounce and those who don’t live within 25 miles of a store that sold marijuana would be allowed to cultivate a maximum of six plants. A similar taxation system will be put in place.</p>
    <p>Maine’s initiative didn’t <em>initially</em> have enough signatures to make it to the November ballot but the campaign successfully sued to get signatures validated. 2.5 ounces would be allowed to be possessed. Also legal will be the possession, cultivation, and transportation of “up to ‘6 flowering marijuana plants, 12 immature marijuana plants and unlimited seedlings, and possess all the marijuana produced by the marijuana plants at that person’s residence’ for those 21 years and older.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/06/legal-marijuana-way-arizona/">Arizona</a> has been on the route to marijuana legalization for some time now but the realistic launch is just around the corner. The ’Legalization and Regulation of Marijuana Act‘ initiative should be on the ballot in Arizona this November. Adults 21-and-up could possess a single ounce at one time. They could also grow a maximum of six plants in an enclosed, locked space in their homes but the grown marijuana would not be able to leave the home outside of the single permissible ounce per instance. No more than 12 total marijuana plants can be grown at once.</p>
    <p>Massachusetts has an initiative to regulate marijuana in the same way alcohol is regulated. Alongside the initiatives produced in other states, the potential changes in Massachusetts would create a taxed and regulated marijuana industry. Adults could posses one ounce in public and ten ounces in a locked space in their homes. The cultivation of 6 plants would also be legal.</p>
    <p>The DEA may be making medicinal usage federally legal <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/08/dea-lawyer-confirms-medicinal-marijuana-will-legal/">sometime this year</a>, as well. The deadline keeps getting pushed back, however, so we shall see how that plays out.</p>
