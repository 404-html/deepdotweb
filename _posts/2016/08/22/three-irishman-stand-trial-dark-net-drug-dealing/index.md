    <p>Kyle Hall, Richard Sinclair, and Stephen Rodgers were all arrested for dealing MDMA as well as other drugs on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/dark-net-market-comparison-chart/">the dark net</a>. The men were set to appear in front of the magistrate on Friday. Police in Northern Ireland found ecstasy, marijuana, and diazepam tablets worth over 100,000 GBP (131,000 USD). The seizure took place in Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and east Belfast a year ago.</p>
    <p>Hall, of Chamberlain Street in Belfast, Sinclair from Coleraine, face charges from the possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply, and possession of criminal property. Sinclair is accused singly of importing large quantities of ecstasy.</p>
    <p>Rodgers from Co Antrim, is being charged with the supply of Class A, B, and C drugs, along with converting criminal property. All offences are believed to be committed between January 2014, and August 2015. At the initial hearing, the men were accused of buying and selling drugs online, using the post to ship them, and accepting bitcoin as payment.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/men-accused-of-running-major-drugs-operations-on-dark-web-34957444.html">Police uncovered lists</a> containing customer names, emails, shipping information, different types of drugs, the amounts that were being sold, as well as purchases, and sales of drugs online. These lists were found in Sinclair’s bedroom.</p>
    <p>Along with the drugs and lists, police found thousands of pounds in cash. During preliminary proceedings defense attorneys agreed with the prosecution in the fact that each of the three men has a case in which they need to answer for. All three men declined to give any evidence, or provide any witnesses this early in the case.</p>
    <p>District Judge Alan White granted the prosecution’s request to have the men stand trial in Belfast Magistrate’s Court. The men were released on bail, but not before they were given a message by Judge Alan White: ”You will be informed of a date for your arraignment, turn up on that date,”</p>
