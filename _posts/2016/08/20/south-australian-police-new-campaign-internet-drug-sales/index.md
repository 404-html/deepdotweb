    <p>Four South Australian men, their ages ranging from 23 to 32, were arrested in August under various drug charges in connection with a new campaign by the South Australia Police to curb sales of controlled substances over the internet.</p>
    <p>According to the Department’s Serious and Organized Crime Branch, who are responsible for drug cases and will be leading the new effort, the four accused were not working together, and were all arrested on separate charges.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.police.sa.gov.au/sa-police-news-assets/front-page-news/police-target-online-drug-dealers#.V6zCeZgrJhH">In a statement</a>, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Crameri, from the Drug and Organized Crime Task Force, made clear the extent of the crackdown:</p>
    <p>“It makes no difference to police if you are dealing drugs on a street corner, in a club or online – we will target those trafficking drugs to the people of South Australia…Police will continue to monitor internet sites used by people offering to sell illicit substances.  And we will target these people no matter how small the amount.”</p>
    <p>The four arrested to date, who will all appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A 30-year-old man from Adelaide who has been charged with trafficking a controlled drug and is expected to appear in court on Friday (5 August).</li>
    <li>A 23-year-old man from Angle Vale who has been charged with trafficking a controlled drug and is expected to appear in court on Friday (5 August).</li>
    <li>A 25-year-old man from Greenwith who has been charged with trafficking a controlled drug and is expected to appear in court on 24 August.</li>
    <li>A 32-year-old man from Aldgate who has been charged with trafficking a controlled drug, cultivation of a controlled plant for sale, possessing prescribed equipment and possessing a controlled drug for sale and is expected to appear in court on 2 September.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/CONTROLLED%20SUBSTANCES%20ACT%201984/CURRENT/1984.52.UN.PDF">Controlled Substances Act 1984 (SA)</a>, the maximum penalty for a person who traffics in a controlled drug use is $50,000 and imprisonment for 10 years.</p>
