    <p>Joshua Lucas, a 26-year-old from Norwalk, Connecticut, is facing serious charges after a package addressed to him was intercepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p>
    <p><a href="http://wtnh.com/2016/08/19/more-than-750-grams-of-mdma-ecstasy-delivered-to-suspect/">The package contained over</a> 750 grams of MDMA, the substance commonly known as the street drug ecstasy. Border Protection contacted Norwalk police and alerted them to the situation. A controlled drop of the package was then carried out at Lucas’s residence. Law Enforcement made sure to acquire a warrant for Lucas’ resident first and foremost, even before the controlled drop was executed.</p>
    <p>Lucas signed for the package, and was immediately taken into custody. Police started an in-home search shortly after the arrest. His home was described by law enforcement as having the same materials and tools needed for drug manufacturing. Among other charges, Lucas is facing possession of a hallucinogen, intent to sell, possession of a drug factory setting, and possession of drugs within 1500 feet of a school.</p>
