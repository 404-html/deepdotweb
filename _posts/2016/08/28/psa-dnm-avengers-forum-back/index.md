    <p>The <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/darknet-avengers-dnmavengers/">Darknet Market Avengers</a>, properly known and referred to as the DNM Avengers, started ages ago as a service to promote harm reduction in drug usage related to the darknet markets. Both the Avengers forum and subreddit have been shut down for some time. Over time dramatic changes have been made, and as a result, the forum is back up and running. New user registration is now open to the public.</p>
    <p>As a community, the DNM Avengers have always had harm reduction as the driving force behind the community. They aim to “democratize drug testing by allowing users to send their drugs off to a lab and then paying them back once they submit verified results.” A common example of this is under-dosed LSD, but the real harm reduction comes when a vendor’s “heroin” is found to be containing Fentanyl or even something more dangerous like <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/18/police-intercept-package-mail-containing-1kg-carfentanil/">Carfentanil</a>.</p>
    <p>The process is outlined as follows. Users send a portion of a substance ordered off a darknet marketplace to Energy Control, a drug testing lab that <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/06/energy-control-drug-testing-service-for-deepweb-users/">works in collaboration</a> with darknet marketplaces. Energy Control then tests the product and sends the results back to the original user. These results are verified and posted on the DNM Avengers forum, letting readers know if a vendor on a specific marketplace is selling the product advertised.</p>
    <p>When a user submits verified evidence of a drug from a specific vendor, the Avengers either partially reimburse or fully reimburse the user for the cost of the test. The goal is to fully reimburse anyone who goes through this process. However, since the community remains funded by donations, sometimes the funds to make a full reimbursement are not available.</p>
    <p>More about what the Avengers do and stand for can be found here in an early PSA by <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/21/psa-the-dnmavengers-harm-reduction-and-drug-testing-forum/">DNM Avengers Admins</a>.</p>
    <p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/4zmpsl/dnm_avengers_forum_is_back/">Reddit post</a> made on August 26<sup>th</sup>, /r/DnmAvenger announced that the new forum is back up and running and user registration is open.</p>
    <blockquote><p>The message by the DNM Avengers admin is as follows:</p>
    <p><em>Hey, everyone. I just wanted to let you know that we are back! I hope you find the site to be faster and more stable. We have put a lot of work into this project. Now it is time to relaunch and move full steam ahead! The site looks exactly the same as ER originally designed. Everyone&#8217;s accounts are intact and all the posts are there.</em></p>
    <p><em>We are starting by opening the forums back up, but we are not making a big push for donations right now. I still haven&#8217;t figured out what we are going to do about the wallet, but for now I have sole control of it. I have a few test codes I am giving away based on responses from the community about who and what they want tested.</em></p>
    <p><em>I wanted a mod to approve the address before I posted it here, but for now I will just post it like this:</em></p>
    <p><em>dnmavengeradt4vo . onion</em></p>
    <p><em>Thank you for your continued support, and I hope we can continue to serve this community as a source of knowledge and affordable testing. We have a few new ideas we are working on, and I hope everyone will come by and check us out soon.</em></p>
    <p><em>We are continuing what we do in memory of ECR. He was a great man, and he will always be missed. I learned so much from him in such a little time. I wish I could have known him longer!</em></p>
    <p><em>And ER if you are out there&#8230; we will miss you, man. I hope you can join our ranks again one day.</em></p></blockquote>
    <p><em> </em></p>
    <p>Like /r/DnmAvengers wrote in his post, the forum does look exactly as it did before. However,  it is blazingly fast now – much faster than it has been in the past. More information will be coming in the future, but for now the community would benefit greatly from an influx of new users that are able to help make the darknet markets a better, safer place.</p>
