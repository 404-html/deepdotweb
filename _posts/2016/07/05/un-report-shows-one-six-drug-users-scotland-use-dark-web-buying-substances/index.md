    <p>A recent UN report shows that 1 in 6 persons in Scotland who uses drugs are ordering their “packages” <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/one-six-scottish-drug-users-8283087#39x8Db5AuXcY0Eip.97">from the dark web</a>. The research also shows that Scotland has one of the biggest percentages of dark net users per country. They came sixth behind Sweden, Poland, Norway, Denmark and England and Wales.</p>
    <p>According to the United Nations report, Scottish dark net users buy mostly magic mushrooms and ecstasy tablets from the illegal marketplaces. The study shows concerns on criminals raising funds by trafficking drugs. The UN made this statement:</p>
    <p>“This raises concerns in terms of the potential of the dark net to attract new users by facilitating access to drugs in a setting that allows users to avoid direct contact with criminals and law enforcement authorities.”</p>
    <p>There have been a number of successful worldwide operations to shut down websites on the dark net. For example, in 2014, the Europol led Operation Onymous led to the closure of 33 dark web sites. However, according to the UN, one illegal marketplace shuts down and another opens.</p>
    <p>The UN even conducted interviews with drugs users who bought their substances from the dark net. At this research, interviewees said the quality of drugs online was better and there is less risk to their safety since they weren’t dealing directly with criminals. According to the United Nations report, the statistics show 102,000 drug users from the 2015 Global Drug Survey.</p>
