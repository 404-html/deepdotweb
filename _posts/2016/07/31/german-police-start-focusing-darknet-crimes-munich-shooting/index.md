    <p>The gunman who killed nine people in a rampage in Munich on Friday had <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/24/munich-gunman-got-weapon-darknet/">purchased his 9mm Glock 17 on the deepweb</a>, investigators discovered in a search of his home. As a result, in the latest annual report on cyber crime, German police say they will be making new efforts to fight crime on the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/dark-net-market-comparison-chart/">darknet</a>.</p>
    <p>According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-cyber-idUSKCN1071KW">Reuters</a>, Holger Muench, head of Germany&#8217;s Federal Police (BKA), told journalists that “We [the BKA] see that the dark net is a growing trading place and therefore we need to prioritize our investigations here.&#8221; Encrypted communications through Tor are making it difficult to determine how the Munich shooter got his gun. “The investigation is very difficult,” a police spokesperson told the press.</p>
    <p>Muench said that while they had taken five <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">darknet marketplaces</a> out of circulation in the previous year, the BKA wants to start focusing on the criminals who are using the sites for buying and selling, not just the marketplace as a whole. Especially focusing on those who use the darknet to illegally obtain weapons.</p>
    <p>A Frankfurt prosecutor who specializes in cybercrime, Georg Ungefuk, acknowledges that drugs are the most common items on the deepweb and “the [weapon] scene is more withdrawn than the drug scene.” He goes on to explain that a special unit of the Frankfurt prosecutors office had arrested several darknet weapons vendors last year, but not enough to make up for how quickly new sellers emerge.</p>
    <p>The BKA spokesperson says cyber crime cost Germany $44.5 million last year, and only 32% of cases had been solved. Cyber crime is on the rise and the German Federal Police plan on being more vigilant in their efforts to stop it.</p>
    <p>Germany&#8217;s firearm laws are well-known as being some of the strictest in the world which makes the situation even more threatening. Officials are concerned that others will realize how easily the 18-year-old was able to illegally obtain the gun and try the process for themselves. Police say that the deepweb makes anonymously purchasing weapons easy – even for those with no criminal ties.</p>
    <p>This isn&#8217;t the only country cracking down on users of darknet marketplaces; just recently India had its first <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/25/police-punjab-busy-investigating-first-related-btc-crime/">deepweb related case.</a></p>
