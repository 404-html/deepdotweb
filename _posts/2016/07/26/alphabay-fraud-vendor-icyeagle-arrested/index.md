    <p>Aaron James Glende, 35, of Winona, AKA “IcyEagle” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/icyeagle-dark-web-vendor-stolen-information-charged-atlanta">was arrested</a> by the FBI in Atlanta and was charged with bank fraud, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The indictment says that Glende was selling fraud related products on Alphabay, a marketplace on the dark net. U. S. Attorney John Horn said this in a statement about the suspect:</p>
    <p>“Glende allegedly sold stolen bank account information on a website designed to traffic criminal goods and services, including weapons, stolen credit cards, and illegal narcotics. As cyber criminals increasingly trade financial information for cash, citizens must be vigilant with their account information.”</p>
    <p>“The threat posed by cyber criminals is a persistently increasing problem for everyday citizens here in the U.S. and abroad. This investigation and resulting arrest clearly illustrates that the FBI, however, will not cease in its effort to identify, locate, arrest and seek prosecution of these criminals regardless of how deep in the digital underground they reside,” added J. Britt Johnson, Special Agent in Charge from the FBI’s Atlanta Field Office.</p>
    <p>According to official court information, Glende started advertising his services on Alphabay Market on November 5, 2015.  On May 4, 2016, IcyEagle started selling stolen bank account information on AlphaBay, including high-balanced SunTrust hacked bank accounts for as cheap as $66.99.</p>
    <p>Around March and April 2016, an undercover agent of the Bureau purchased SunTrust account information from Glende. The stolen info IcyEagle had sent the agent confirmed that it contained usernames, passwords, physical addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and bank account numbers that belonged to five different SunTrust Bank customers.</p>
    <p>Glende was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 28, 2016, and is facing charges in front of US Magistrate Judge Janet F. King. Court documents say the indictment only contains charges so Glende is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the government’s burden to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. The FBI is being the head of the investigation. In their work, they were assisted by Homeland Security Investigations, the U.S. Postal Investigation Service, and the Winona, Minnesota Police Department.</p>
