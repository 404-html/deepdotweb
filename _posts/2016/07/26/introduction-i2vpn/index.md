    <p>Service introduction &#8211; as it was provided by the service owner: I2VPN (<strong>i2vpnraen5bggqge.onion</strong>) is a new <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/vpn-comparison-chart/">VPN</a> that provides you guaranteed anonymity and security through a anonymizing network known as I2P. I2VPN is rather unique and wraps all of its connections via random computers in the world (like Tor) which none of us own.. I2VPN has also many features such as transparency, Whonix-style workstations, a API, et cetra.</p>

    <p>Service fee is around 4$, Payments are easy and can be done using any of these methods: BTC, DASH.</p>
    <p>One of the I2VPN&#8217;s many features is: disposable exit, Disposable exit is something that no other VPN has, our exits are disposable and do not contain any information about you. (Be it your<br />
    username/password/hashes or your OpenVPN PSK) When you connect to I2VPN, you do so to our trusted main which are hosted in-house by us, no colocation, no dedicated server, no VPS. Main contains everything about you and is highly secured, using technologies like Qubes, Tor, I2P and many others, Exit only sees a single connection (from main) and only stores a temporary PSK that is to be regenerated every time main reconnects.</p>
    <p><strong>Another feature is API:</strong></p>
    <p>I2VPN is one of the few VPNs with API, our API allows you to:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Dynamically readjusting applications which periodically change locations.</li>
    <li>Applications which require more than one tunnels.</li>
    <li>Only to be limited by your imagination.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>About privacy and anonymity:</strong></p>
    <p>Most of our exits are outside US, and the main node itself is outside of US. All statuses of all servers are publicly shown on the website. All emails sent will be either PGP encrypted (if you offer us your PGP public key) or be PGP signed (if not PGP key) No logs are kept, all logs are disposed when you log out or switch servers.</p>

    <p><strong>Stability:</strong></p>
    <p>We are not aiming to run off with your money&#8230; We offer escrow so that you can be sure that we won&#8217;t run off. One of the biggest problems with VPN is their abuses and notices&#8230; I2VPN is very strong with abuses, if we see that someone is abusing the service and doing something that we don&#8217;t accept, we will temporarily block all connections to that endpoint. That being said, we don&#8217;t consider P2P as a abuse, file-sharing is considered to be a right by I2VPN developers and we won&#8217;t implicitly log your connections if you use P2P.<br />
    I2VPN also conforms to notices even if we are based in darknet, with that being said, we can&#8217;t handover any information (logs) because we don&#8217;t simply have them&#8230;</p>
    <p><strong>Future improvements:</strong></p>
    <p>We are aiming to complete our API system and making a community center for all democratic polls on what they would like to see in I2VPN..</p>
    <p>And 2-per-week drive-in with movies (which are selected by users) and a 24/7 music stream (music also selected by users).</p>
