    <p>Macan Sahota (24), a student studying computer studies and ethical hacking at the Leeds Met University, was <a href="http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/leeds-computing-student-jailed-over-vile-images-accessed-from-dark-web-1-7991107">jailed for 16 months</a> for downloading 386 “still and moving” child pornography images from the dark web. The content featured babies being sexually abused and pictures showing children and animals.</p>
    <p>According to Jonathan Sharp from prosecution, the law enforcement authorities discovered Sahota’s illicit activities and executed a search warrant on his Leeds home address in March 2015.</p>
    <p>Leeds Crown Court heard that Sahota not just downloaded the images for “personal use”, but he also distributed them to other people. He pleaded guilty to two offenses of possession of indecent images of children, two of possession of extreme pornographic images, one of distributing indecent images of children and one of publishing obscene images. Mohammed Zawa, in the student’s defense, said that Sahota had stopped accessing the material by the time police detected his offending as “he was ashamed of what he had been doing.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Nawaz, Sahota’s attorney, said the computing student came from a good family and worked for the family takeaway food business. He also added that his client’s mother was a prison officer:</p>
    <p>“He knows he has brought great shame on them.”</p>
    <p>Judge Jacqueline Davies told Sahota after sentencing him:</p>
    <p>“At the relevant time, you were involved in a course at university relating to computer matters. Those were obviously of assistance to you in your commission of these offenses.”</p>
