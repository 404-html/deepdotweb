    <p>Mark Dornan (22), bought weed from the dark web and had the intention of selling it, however, the UK Border Force intercepted a package from Belgium with half a kilo of marijuana inside. Soon after that, law enforcement authorities obtained a search warrant and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-36530120">raided the man’s home</a> in Raploch, Stirling on April 8.</p>
    <p>According to Stirling Sheriff Court, in the bedroom of Dornan, officers found a shoe box, which contained digital scales, around £570 in cash, and a card with notations. A message was also found on a phone about an agreement to supply someone with half-ounce of weed for the amount of £125.</p>
    <p>Dornan, working as a plasterer in Raploch, pleaded guilty to the charge of being concerned in the supply of herbal cannabis. His lawyer, Frazer McCready said that his client had no criminal record. His statement goes by:</p>
    <p>&#8220;He was having financial difficulties and was clearly beyond his means. Unfortunately rather than go to some sort of debt counseling, as he is now doing, he foolishly decided to embark on this exercise with regard to his debts by involving himself in the supply of cannabis. Clearly that type of drug was going to be intercepted, and it was. There were consequences immediately.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Dornan that despite the fact he had no offending history, he had &#8220;no alternative but to impose the jail sentence, because of the value of the drug involved”. Dornan was jailed for six months in prison.</p>
