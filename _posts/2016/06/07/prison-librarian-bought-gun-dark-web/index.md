    <p>Dwain Osborne (26), a prison librarian at HMP Brixton, <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/drugdealing-prison-librarian-bought-gun-on-the-dark-web-a3259961.html">ordered a Glock 19 handgun and 100 rounds of ammunition</a> to it from a dark web marketplace and he wanted the gun delivered to his home address in Penge, which Osborne also used as the center of his drug dealing operation.</p>
    <p>The dealer who was selling the gun to Osborne was a US agent who notified the National Crime Agency (NCA), who then raided the man’s home in October. The prison librarian was released then on bail, however, police officers at the second raid on his home in February this year found 10 wraps of cocaine weighing 3.75g, a further amount of 13.8g cocaine, scales, and £735 in cash.</p>
    <p>Prosecutor Tom Forster said Osborne stated that his drugs were for personal use, however, his browsing history contained searches including “how to buy a kilo of cocaine in Peru”:</p>
    <p>“His iPhone and linked laptop both had uploaded a software program called Tor browser, which allows someone using it to browse the internet anonymously, so they can use the dark web and protect their identity while doing so. All tending to suggest a committed interest in cocaine and large amounts of it.”</p>
    <p>Forster also added that law enforcement authorities found a memory card with “details of over 1,000 prisoners in the prison system”, however, later on, that charged was dropped.</p>
    <p>According to Osborne, the reason of his supply of class A drugs was buying them for a friend. However, Judge Gerald Gordon countered the man’s statement on Friday:</p>
    <p>“I’m satisfied the defendant did benefit commercially, at the very least to the extent necessary to fund his own habit. It’s likely it was more than that.”</p>
    <p>Osborne admitted attempted possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, attempted possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life, attempted purchase of a firearm, attempted purchase of ammunition, possession of false identity documents, possession of class B drugs and possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.</p>
    <p>The former prison librarian faces a long prison term and was remanded in custody until he is sentenced on June 17.</p>
