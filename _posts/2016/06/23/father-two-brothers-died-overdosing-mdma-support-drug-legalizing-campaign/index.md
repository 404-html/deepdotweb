    <p>Ray Lakeman, the father of Jacques Lakeman (20) Torin (19) <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brothers-died-side-by-side-hotel-room-5598001">who were found dead in a flat above a pub</a> in Bolton in November 2014, is <a href="http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/father-of-tragic-brothers-backs-uk-campaign-to-legalise-drugs-1-7963448">backing a campaign group</a> called Anyone’s child to legalize and regulate drugs. Both of the father’s children overdosed on MDMA, which they bought from abroad on the dark net.</p>
    <p>Sarah Lakeman, the mother of the tragic brothers, a teacher at Castle Rushen High School, said she does not share her husband’s views.</p>
    <p>Ray Lakeman told the media:</p>
    <p>“The war on drugs is not working – this is the only way to control it and it will also prevent gang warfare and violence. It’s not going away. If I felt my boys were killed because of drugs and knowing that everybody stopped, it would make a difference, but I know it doesn’t. I know friends of Torin’s at Aberystwyth University [where he was studying physics] are still taking drugs – it has not stopped them. Newcastle University is giving out tester kits to students so kids know the drugs they are taking are safe. It’s not stopped it. I’m sure if my boys had known what they were taking they would have stopped and would be alive today. It’s too late for my sons but not for others.”</p>
    <p>He also added in the Mail on Sunday:</p>
    <p>“We insist on the safety and control of alcohol, tobacco, even sugar – so why not with drugs?’</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Sarah felt angry at Torin for buying MDMA on the dark web, in her article she said:</p>
    <p>“He used to be so anti-drugs after seeing his brother’s behavior. The only comfort I take is knowing they were having a nice time, that they were happy and together when they died.”</p>
    <p>Ray said about the mother of the children in response:</p>
    <p>“Sarah’s ambiguous. She is angry – it’s coloring her take on everything. She understands my point of view and is supporting me but has other things to deal with. It’s my viewpoint, not hers. She understands what they are saying but is not 100 percent sure she thinks if being made legal is a good thing.”</p>
    <p>Sarah finished the debate with this statement:</p>
    <p>“I’m a teacher, it would not be very helpful to say I am sharing his stance. I would like to keep out of the debate.”</p>
