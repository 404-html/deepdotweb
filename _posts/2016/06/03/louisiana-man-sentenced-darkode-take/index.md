    <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdla/pr/opelousas-man-sentenced-year-prison-role-major-computer-hacking-forum">29 year old Rory Stephen Guirdy</a>, or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="026942677a726e6d6b762c6b6f">[email&#160;protected]</a> was sentenced by Judge Dee D. Drell for one count of obtaining information by computer from a protected computer. According to court documents, in July 2014 when Guirdy lived in Texas he was part of an online attack of a server in Houston. After, he moved to his grandparents’ house in Louisiana when investigation into the attack started. His hacking career wasn&#8217;t cut short though. After his move, he was hacking personal computers from his grandparents’ home with malware and formed a botnet. He attempted to hack and use 5,000 computers to sell the botnet to another hacker on Darkode. He also joined forces with another hacker to form a plan to steal over $80,000 in bitcoin. Guirdy received half of the bounty gained, which he converted into cash and spent it. On top of all this, he was also found to hack hacked another computer and took over 5,000 active credit card accounts which he was in possession of when the FBI arrested him.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/07/15/darkode-com-seized-by-cross-borders-task-force/">Darkode was taken down in July of 2015</a>. Charges were filed in Louisiana, Pennsylvania and other states against 12 people linked back to Darkode. The charges were announced July 15<sup>th</sup>, 2015 after the FBI gained access by membership to Darkode. Some 20 different nations helped in the effort to search, arrest and charge 70 members and associates all over the world.</p>
    <p>“Cybercrime threatens anyone and everyone in our ever increasingly internet connected world. Computer criminals will not be able to hide or maintain their anonymity, and they will be prosecuted locally, nationally, and internationally. Through coordinated responses and international cooperation of our law enforcement partners, defendants such as Mr. Guidry who are involved in computer hacking forums will see their organizations dismantled and individuals prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Finley stated Wednesday.</p>
    <p>Operation Shrouded Horizon is being conducted by the FBI, Euro-pol and their European Cyber Crime Center. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys James T. Kitchen and Charles A. Eberle of the Western District of Pennsylvania and Trial Attorneys Gavin A. Corn, Marie-Flore Johnson and Harold Chun of CCIPS, Assistant U.S. Attorney Erica O&#8217;Neil of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Myers Namie of the Western District of Louisiana. The Criminal Division&#8217;s Office of International Affairs also provided much needed help.</p>
