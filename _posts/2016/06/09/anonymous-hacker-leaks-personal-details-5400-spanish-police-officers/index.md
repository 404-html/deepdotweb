    <p>A hacker associated with Anonymous <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hacker-claims-leak-personal-data-5400-spanish-police-gag-law-protest-1563490">leaks a data dump</a>, which appears to contain the personal details of around 5,400 members of the Spanish Police. The released information contains full names, email addresses, hashed passwords and national ID numbers. A police investigation just started about the case since a cybercriminal had successfully breached the website of Mutual Social Security Police (mupol.es). It is believed that the hacker’s Twitter account goes by ”@FkPoliceAnonOps”, which has been regularly posting out links to the data to the social media website, however, most of the data has been already removed.</p>
    <p>The hacker added a statement alongside the release of the sensitive data saying the leak was made in response to the controversial Spanish &#8220;gag law&#8221; which came into effect last year and permits the state to levy fines of up to €600,000 (around $668,435) for &#8220;unauthorized protests.&#8221; At the time the law was passed, it was criticized by NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations), civil rights groups and Spanish journalists. UN experts even released a statement on 23 February 2015 saying that it &#8220;penalizes a wide range of actions and behaviors that are essential for the exercise of this fundamental right&#8221;. The cybercriminal also added this statement about the attack:</p>
    <p>&#8220;We are publishing a list of members of your &#8216;force&#8217; in order to make you understand how thin the curtain (or the balaclava) is behind which you are hiding. Make no mistake, with every action, comes a counter-reaction and we all have to pay for our acts! Approximately 5,400 police members&#8217; identities will be revealed and dumped into the free public domain, together with your ID numbers, emails and password hash.&#8221; The hacker claimed to have had access to the police database for more than two weeks.</p>
    <p>The news was only released about a week after the hacker with the username &#8220;Phineas Fisher&#8221; – who is responsible for breaches against spy software sellers Gamma Group and Hacking Team – launched an attack on the union of the Catalan police Mossos D&#8217;Esquadra (Police Force of Catalonia) and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/26/police-catalan-hack/">released a video demonstrating his actions</a>.</p>
    <p>This was not the first attack on the Spanish law enforcement authorities by the Anonymous. In 2012, an&#8221;anti-hack&#8221; operation was carried out in retaliation to arrests of several members of the hacker group.</p>
