    <p>Richard Huckle, dubbed Britain’s worst pedophile for abusing 200 Malaysian children; has been sentenced to 22 life sentences.</p>
    <p>Huckle, a freelance photographer lived in Ashford, Kent, and admitted to numerous offences against children between the ages of six months and 12 years old. The Judge, Peter Rock QC, ordered Huckle to serve a minimum of 25 years in order for him to reflect on his so called “campaign of rape” which spanned some nine years.</p>

He even tried to make his assaults on children a career by <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/11/09/as-drug-markets-are-seized-pedophiles-launch-a-crowdfunding-site/">crowdfunding the release of his images</a>, and was in the process of putting together a manual for pedophiles at the time of his arrest.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2016/06/richard.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14475" src="/imgs/2016/06/richard.jpg" alt="richard" width="400" height="328" srcset="/imgs/2016/06/richard.jpg 400w, /imgs/2016/06/richard-300x246.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
    <p>Among the 200 reported victims of Huckle, 233 children from Christian communities in Kuala Lumpur were identified in 71 charges, even though from Huckle’s own “Pedopoints ledger” the number was much higher. Huckle stood silent, hands folded resembling someone in mid prayer, as Judge Rook sentenced him. Judge Rook told him that his “self-delusion has no bounds” and the 60-page pedophile manual he had written himself was a “truly evil document”.</p>
    <p>“You were and are sexually obsessed with children. You have spent years abusing them. In one of your postings you stated that you had become consumed by your pedophilia,” the judge told him.</p>
    <p>“It is clear from your postings on hidden encrypted pedophilia websites on the dark web, and from the manual you were in the process of drafting, that your life revolved around your obsession with your own sexual gratification by child sex abuse. It is also clear that, had you not been arrested, you planned to continue the same lifestyle using the expertise that you were keen to show off to and share with other abusers so as to continue your sexual exploitation of the children of such communities,” the judge continued.</p>
    <p>Due to Huckle refusing to hand over passwords to encrypted files on his computer, the judge also said,</p>
    <p>“In my view, you may well harbor feelings of regret but there is no feeling of genuine remorse in this case.”</p>
    <p>A woman in the public seating inside the court room was compelled to issue Huckle with her thoughts as he was sentenced, saying “1,000 deaths is too good for you.”</p>
    <p>Huckles first visit to Malaysia was for a teaching gap when he was 19 and fooled everyone into thinking he was a respectable Christian English teacher and philanthropist. Five of the children resided in a foster home for children, and he would sometimes take a girl out to celebrate a birthday, where he would molest them at his home in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Huckle studied IT at a college in Malaysia, and was arrested at Gatwick Airport by NCA agents when he arrived to spend Christmas with his family. Officers took Huckle’s laptop and found more than 20,000 images and videos of him abusing children, and other files which they couldn’t view.</p>
    <p>Among the image and video files, they found his pedophile manual titled “Pedophiles and Poverty: Child Lover Guide”, and a “Pedopoints ledger” which he was awarded marks for the abuse of 191 children. Huckle bragged online saying, “Impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class Western kids.” One of his comments about a victim said, “I’d hit the jackpot, a 3yo girl as loyal to me as my dog and nobody seemed to care.”</p>
    <p>He also crowd-funded the releasing of indecent images of the three-year-old girl in exchange for bitcoins, which he achieved over 100% of his targeted earnings. His parents had no idea, and were horrified when he confessed his crimes. So horrified and shocked that they begged police to take him away and made statements in support of the prosecution in court.</p>
    <p>Prior to his sentencing, he told a psychiatrist that he wanted to put his wild ways behind him and had plans to settle down with a south Indian woman. Contrary to his claims, the court showed a posting made my Huckle in 2013 in which he outlined his plan to marry one of his victims to help him abuse more children.</p>
    <p>The judge came to the conclusion that Huckle posed a substantial risk for an indefinite period. Agent James Traynor, from the NCA’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection command said, “Richard Huckle spent several years integrating himself into the community in which he lived, making himself a trusted figure. But he abused that trust in the worst possible way.”</p>
    <p>“He deliberately travelled to a part of the world where he thought he could abuse vulnerable children without being caught. Borders are no barrier; we are determined that those who go abroad to abuse children will be held to account,” Traynor went on.</p>
    <p>“It is horrifying that Huckle as able to profit from this appalling abuse by using the web to sell images and even films to other pedophiles, emphasizing the importance, yet again, of the need for cohesive, global effort from both authorities and internet service providers to combat this vile trade,” Traynor continued.</p>
    <p>“It is hard to put into words the sheer depravity of this case. For almost nine years, Richard Huckle subjected at least 23 children, some of them very young, to the most horrifying abuse imaginable. Due to the determination of the CPS and investigating authorities, this dangerous man has been brought to justice and is no longer a risk to children,” Anthony Hill, the International Justice and Organized Crime Prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service said about Huckle.</p>
