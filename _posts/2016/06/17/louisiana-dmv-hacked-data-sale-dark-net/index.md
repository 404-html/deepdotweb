    <p>A hacker known as ‘NSA’ operating on &#8220;<a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=therealdeal">Therealdeal</a>&#8221; <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/dark-net-market-comparison-chart/">dark net market</a> is selling over a quarter million driver’s license records he obtained from hacking a database from the state of Louisiana. It’s said that the records mainly show crime, traffic offences and the like ranging from speeding, theft and murder.</p>
    <p>With ages from teenagers to seniors, the most common year of birth being 1983. How these figures were bought to light, is still unsure. Most likely from sources at the hacked DMV.  The data for sale contains all the regular info you might think to see in such a data leak, like first and last name, date of birth, zip code, home address and details pertaining to traffic and criminal offences.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.hackread.com/hacker-selling-louisiana-drivers-licence-database/">The sample provided</a> by ‘NSA’ even went into detail about how much one such speeding ticket totaling $204.50 which even showed what Louisiana police district issued the ticket.</p>
    <p>The listing says NSA is asking for 21000000.0000 BTC, or $12153960000.00 USD, NSA posted,</p>
    <p>“Disregard the price on this listing. Make me an offer that you and I can both agree to and I’ll create a private listing that you can use to purchase this database.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/drivers.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14519" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/drivers.png" alt="drivers" width="1241" height="552" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/drivers.png 1241w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/drivers-300x133.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/drivers-1024x455.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1241px) 100vw, 1241px" /></a></p>
    <p>In the event this data is the real deal, the state of Louisiana could be in for a wild ride while they attempt to find out who did it, and for what reasons. The records are still available on the dark net for purchase, and no official statements have been released from the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles. Some speculate that they may not even be aware of the data breach yet.</p>
    <p>We are all too familiar with data breaches of this time, in example; a few months ago researchers uncovered around 191 million US voter registration records. Along with this, 93.4 million Mexican voter’s data were found as well.</p>
