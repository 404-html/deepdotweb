    <p>The U.S. Government and Microsoft are squaring off with each other now over an Irishman wanted by the FBI.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/silk-road-emails-center-microsofts-irish-email-battle-us-government-report-2385320">The Irishman</a>, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/07/15/libertas-us-seeks-extradition-of-wicklow-man-over-silk-road/">Gary Davis, from Wicklow</a> (a.k.a Silk Road Admin Libertas) is currently fighting an extradition case to the United States in order to not face charged for is alleged involvement in Silk Road. Davis is said to have been another admin on the site at the time the FBI shut it down.</p>

    <p>The U.S. DOJ served Microsoft with a warrant in relation to an unnamed drug investigation in late 2013, asking for data from a Microsoft outlook account.</p>
    <p>“If they’re going to upset an ally, as they are doing here with Microsoft, and potentially with Ireland, it could only be something which has embarrassed them or upset them. Silk Road fits that,” Paul Ennis, who is a researcher at the University College Dublin’s cent for Innovation, Technology and organization told the Times.</p>
    <p>Davis provided further support for Ennis’ claims <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryDavisIRL/status/722372068424163328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">by tweeting</a>,</p>
    <p>“Some whistling wind informs me that this centers around my email. Not playing by the rules again, FBI? Shocking.”</p>
    <p>The case is currently being considered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the judgement is highly anticipated by tech. companies and privacy advocate groups alike. <a href="http://digitalconstitution.com/2014/12/business-media-civil-society-speak-key-privacy-case/">Amicus briefs</a> from U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Verizon, ATT, Cisco, and Amazon, Irish Government, ACLU, the EFF and the U.S. Changer of Commerce have all backed Microsoft’s stance.</p>
    <p>Tuesday, E. Joshua Rosenkranz, one of Microsoft’s lawyers cited an opinion issued Monday by the Supreme Court in another case that Microsoft believes backs up the argument that shows that U.S. laws cannot apply outside the U.S. unless Congress has provided for it. The ruling is expected next month, but is expected to be appealed by the Supreme Court for whoever loses this battle.</p>
