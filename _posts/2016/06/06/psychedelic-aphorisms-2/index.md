    <p>BEGINNING OF THE SECOND INSTALLMENT</p>
    <p>*           *           *</p>
    <p>Sons and daughter of robbers, hunting for wealth and treasure.</p>
    <p>*           *           *</p>
    <p>Those who came before, carving signs as they went, for us to resdiscover.</p>
    <p>Each sign a guarded castle, wherein their treasures rest.</p>
    <p>Each sign, when cracked – a world of understanding.</p>
    <p>*           *           *</p>
    <p>Let us strive to be as those who came before – those who raised much noise and clamour.</p>
    <p>Let us strive to be as those who came before – those who stormed the heavens, and looted all they found.</p>
    <p>Let us strive to be as those who came before – those who went down swinging, shoulder to shoulder, naked with their spears on high.</p>
    <p>*           *           *</p>
    <p>Scarred survivors, gathering ‘round the fires.</p>
    <p>Learning and re-learning how to trap a thought – and see what comes crawling out.</p>
    <p>Learning and re-learning how to hold one’s breath – and see what comes crawling out.</p>
    <p>Learning and re-learning how to take a closer look – and see what comes crawling out.</p>
    <p>*           *           *</p>
    <p>A midsummer feast…</p>
    <p>… With things in bloom…</p>
    <p>… And the all, bleating at its maker.</p>
    <p>*           *           *</p>
    <p>“When do I bring him to you?”</p>
    <p>“When the third white hair appears in his beard. Or, well, if he starts whining and crying until you can no longer sleep. Whichever comes first.”</p>
    <p>*           *           *</p>
    <p>“… And raise and keep a worthy alphabet, for me to enter upon my next return.”</p>
    <p>*           *           *</p>
    <p>END OF THE SECOND INSTALLMENT</p>
