    <p>This week’s summary of various cryptocurrency news and developments</p>
    <p><strong>New developments:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Web broswer Brave to start paying publishers bitcoin through micropayments</strong></p>
    <p>Brave, a web-browser co-created by ex-Mozzilla CEO Brandan Eich that blocks ads, has <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/web-browser-brave-wants-to-pay-publishers-with-bitcoin-2016-9">launched Brave Payments in beta</a>, a solution that aims to reward publishers with bitcoin as a way for them to keep on earning revenue, even though the ads are blocked. The payment is to be adjusted according to the amount of time users spend on the website, and how much users are willing to pay, as they select a monthly budget and which sites they pay – it uses BitGo as a wallet and Coinbase as a marketplace to purchase bitcoins.</p>
    <p><strong>Bitfinex started to pay out customer refunds</strong></p>
    <p>Following Bitfinex’s plan to get the exchange back online the way it used to be before it was hacked, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitfinex-pays-wave-refunds/">it has already started to reimburse its clients, with 1.1812 percent of outstanding BFX tokens being redeemed by the exchange</a>. Bitfinex has purchased these tokens at a $1 value per token, almost double the price of its current market value of 50-60 cents. According to a few sources, the exchange has also signed a letter of intent with <a href="https://bnktothefuture.com/">an online investment firm called BnkToTheFuture</a>, in order to compensate customers by giving them equity in Bitfinex.</p>
    <p><strong>LeakedSource revealed information about BTC-E and BitcoinTalk Forum breaches</strong></p>
    <p>In 2014, bitcoin exchange BTC-E was breached, and in 2015 the same thing happened to one off the biggest bitcoin forums out there, BitcoinTalk. Recently, data breach indexing resource <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-exchange-btc-e-bitcointalk-forum-breaches-details-revealed/">LeakedSource has revealed information regarding the two attack</a>s that seem to show both websites were keen on security and due to superior password security and unique technology, which means even though user data has been compromised, their password are either extremely hard to crack, or completely un-crackable.</p>
    <p><strong>Jaxx Wallet to remove Dash, as Apple doesn’t approve it</strong></p>
    <p>Dash is currently the eight largest cryptocurrency in the world, if we evaluate it according to market cap. Recently, the multi-platform wallet <a href="http://fintechlab.com.br/index.php/2016/09/01/apple-doesnt-approve-of-dash-demands-removal-from-jaxx-wallet-ccn-financial-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-news/">Jaxx had to remove it from its platform as Apple does not approve of it</a>. Jaxx founder Anthony Di lorio has revealed that Apple appears to only approve of a few coins, such as the following: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Doge, Ripple, Litecoin.</p>
    <p>Apple’s disapproval came right after Jaxx announced to its users it would include Dash on its platforms. A few notable members of the cryptocurrency community disapproved of the tech giant’s move<a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/771210141710454785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Value of untraceable cryptocurrency Monero tripled in the last few days</strong></p>
    <p>The price of <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/monero-cryptocurrency-dark-net-drug-dealers-hope-more-anonymous-than-bitcoin-alphabay">Monero, an untraceable cryptocurrency</a>, has <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/price_charts/monero/usd">more than tripled in the last few days</a> going from nearly $2.50 up to almost $8.10. The currency is merely two years old but according to some sources its price is only now skyrocketing due to it finally being accepted by several darknet markets such as AlphaBay. Reportedly, trading volume has also sparked lately through exchanges such as <a href="https://poloniex.com/">Poloniex</a>. Monero is maintained by <a href="https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/people">seven core developers</a> and is an open source project.</p>
    <p><strong>World affairs:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Tonybet, an Estonian online betting and gaming site has started to accept bitcoin</strong></p>
    <p>A partnership has been struck between Tonybet.com <a href="https://spectrocoin.com/">and SpectroCoin &#8211; a cryptocurrency wallet</a> – so that the Estonian website can be <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/online-betting-site-tonybet-accepts-bitcoin/">one of the first well-established betting websites to accept bitcoin and allow users to exchange it to fiat currencies</a> while playing, something rare in other gambling websites that accept cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin can be used both to deposit and withdraw money. The move comes in an attempt to promote bitcoin in Europe, and to help bring in more customers. According to a spokesperson, a lot of new players started to arrive as soon as bitcoin deposits were introduced.</p>
    <p><strong>Bank of Canada published a document that suggests adopting bitcoin could stabilize its price</strong></p>
    <p>The central <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bank-canada-paper-bitcoin-adoption-stabilize-price/">Bank of Canada has recently published a document in which it suggests that the exchange rates of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could stabilize</a> – or at least become less volatile – should it be adopted by more financial institutions and businesses. In the document, the authors write about how the price of bitcoin can be influenced by factors such as speculation, buyers believing whether or not it will be adopted by mainstream financial institutions, its demand, and its amount of daily operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin price close to the $600 mark, again</strong></p>
    <p>At the time this article was written, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/charts">bitcoin’s price was roughly at $590</a> after it suddenly increased in value. Throughout the week, it was roughly stable at the $570 &#8211; $575 mark. Volatility is always a factor to consider when looking at the value of bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter. The price coming close to $600 may be linked to some of the news within this article.</p>
