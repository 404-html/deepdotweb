    <p>Dwain Osborne, a 26-year-old former librarian at Brixton Prison, had <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/dark-web-constable-had-researched-rhys-jones-murder-a3342556.html">researched</a> the Rhys Jones murder when he ordered a Glock 19 handgun and 100 rounds of ammo from the dark web.</p>
    <p>Osborne <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/06/07/prison-librarian-bought-gun-dark-web/">purchased</a> the gun from an undercover US agent who notified the National Crime Agency (NCA) of the case. The man wanted to deliver the weapon to his home address in Penge, which was also the center of his drug dealing operation. A fake gun was sent to the prison librarian, shortly after, law enforcement authorities raided his home. Police found both Class A and B drugs at the scene.</p>
    <p>After the arrest, Osborne was released on bail, however, in February, police found 17.55 grams of cocaine at the man’s home, scales and £735 in cash. Tom Forster from prosecution said the drugs were for personal use, although, authorities found searches like “how to buy a kilo of cocaine in Peru” on the librarian’s computer.</p>
    <p>“His iPhone and linked laptop both had uploaded a software program called Tor browser, which allows someone using it to browse the internet anonymously, so they can use the dark web and protect their identity while doing so. All tending to suggest a committed interest in cocaine and large amounts of it,” Forster said.</p>
    <p>Osborne admitted attempted possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, attempted possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life, attempted purchase of a firearm, attempted purchase of ammunition, possession of false identity documents, possession of class B drugs and possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.</p>
    <p>Police also found a search where Osborne was researching into the Rhys Jones murder. Jones was an 11-year-old kid who was shot by a gang member when he was on his way home in Liverpool, 2007. This search history could mean that the former librarian could have had intentions for murder, however, this allegation is yet to be proven.</p>
    <p>Osborne was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date.</p>
