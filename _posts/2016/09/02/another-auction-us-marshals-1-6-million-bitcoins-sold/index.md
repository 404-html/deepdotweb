    <p><a id="post-15310-_gjdgxs"></a> The US Marshals Service <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/10/09/us-marshalls-to-auction-ross-ulbrichts-remaining-bitcoin-stash-worth-11-million/">has again auctioned</a> bitcoins seized from cybercriminals. This time, $1.6 million worth of BTC were <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/292275-us-marshals-auction-off-16m-in-bitcoin">sold</a> to one successful bidder on Monday.</p>
    <p>CoinDesk, a website reporting on virtual currencies, confirmed with the Marshals, that four total bids were made <a href="https://www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2016/bitcoinauction/">at this auction</a>.</p>
    <p>The US Marshals acquired the bitcoins from several cases involving the Silk Road case, including the cases involving Ross Ulbricht.</p>
    <p>The Marshals are selling the seized BTC in a series of auctions. The last auction was held on November 15 when 11 bidders bought 44,000 bitcoins worth $14.6 million. From this auction, only 2.8 came from Silk Road. Most of the cryptocurrency in the auction was seized from a Silk Road drug vendor, Matthew Gillum, who is currently serving a nine-year prison sentence.</p>
    <p>Additionally, 664 BTC came from Sean Roberson, a vendor arrested for selling counterfeit credit and debit cards online. Another 65 bitcoins came from Carl Force, a former corrupt Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was arrested for stealing bitcoins during the Silk Road investigation. Both men were sentenced to 78 months in prison.</p>
