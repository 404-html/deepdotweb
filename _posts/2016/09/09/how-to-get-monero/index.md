    <p>You&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a> (XMR) by now. It&#8217;s a cryptocurrency which features privacy and untraceable transactions. Several darknet markets, including <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/23/alphabay-oasis-markets-begin-accepting-monero-payments/">AlphaBay and Oasis</a>, have chosen Monero to be their private cryptocurrency. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/02/16/interview-sigaint-darknet-email-admin/">SIGAINT</a>, a darknet email service, has also recently provided a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> relay for Monero transactions in an effort to help Monero transactions stay completely within the darknet, if the user so desires. And, if you watch the cryptocurrency markets, you know that value of Monero has skyrocketed. All of this has created a greater demand for Monero.</p>

    <p><strong>So, how do you get Monero?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>You Can Trade for Monero through Exchanges</strong></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15366 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/09/word-image-9.jpeg" /> <img class="wp-image-15367 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/09/word-image-10.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2016/09/word-image-10.jpeg 473w, /imgs/2016/09/word-image-10-300x48.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
    <p>If you already have Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, you can trade them for Monero at cryptocurrency exchanges. <a href="https://bittrex.com/">Bittrex</a> and <a href="https://poloniex.com/">Poloniex</a> are the larger exchanges, with Poloniex having the most volume of Monero trades. A list of exchanges which trade Monero may be found <a href="https://getmonero.org/getting-started/merchants">here</a>. Fees on the exchanges vary, but 0.25% when buying seems standard.</p>
    <p><a href="https://bitsquare.io/">B</a><a href="https://bitsquare.io/">itsquare.io</a> is a decentralized exchange, meaning that you can trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for Monero peer-to-peer through their open-source software. For now, their fees are a little higher than the centralized exchanges, but you do have increased anonymity with decentralized exchanges.</p>
    <p><strong>You can use ShapeShift.io</strong></p>
    <p><strong><img class="wp-image-15368 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/09/word-image-11.jpeg" /></strong></p>
    <p>Exchanges work well, but they require an email address and sometimes require other personal information. If you don&#8217;t want to provide any of your personal information to an exchange, you can use <a href="https://shapeshift.io/">ShapeShift.io</a> to instantly convert Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies into Monero. No email or password is required. If you deposit Bitcoin, you can be sent Moneroj (“Moneroj” is plural for “Monero”) instantly (within a few minutes). At the time of this article, Monero&#8217;s price was around 12.5% higher on ShapeShift than it was on the exchanges, but the convenience, speed, and greater anonymity may be worth it to you.<br />
    You&#8217;ll need to have a Monero wallet and Monero address to which ShapeShift can send your Moneroj, so be sure to set those up beforehand. Although Monero doesn&#8217;t have an official Graphical User Interface (GUI) wallet yet, it is in development. You can choose to use the official Command Line Interface (CLI) wallet, or the web-based <a href="https://mymonero.com/">MyMonero.com</a> wallet. MyMonero is very easy to use and your private keys are not stored on their server. Still, it&#8217;s best practice to use web wallets for only immediate needs and not for storing large amounts. This applies to all web wallets, not just MyMonero. A list of available Monero wallets may be found <a href="https://getmonero.org/getting-started/choose">here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>You can use MoneroForCash.com to Buy Monero with Cash &#8211; MoneroForCash.com</strong></p>
    <p>The above methods require you to already have Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in order to get Moneroj. But what if you don&#8217;t have Bitcoin? You can post a free ad to buy Monero with cash at <a href="https://moneroforcash.com/">MoneroForCash.com</a>. No email is required to register, although you can provide an email later if you want to receive notifications about your ad from the site. Sellers have to pay “around $0.09 US” per ad. Aside from the registration page which uses a CAPTCHA, the site doesn&#8217;t use JavaScript, so it&#8217;s TOR-friendly. You can choose to buy Monero in person with cash, through the mail with cash or money order, or other methods. Since trading is person-to-person, your Moneroj never goes to the site and thus can&#8217;t be stolen by the site or hacked from the site. The site is new and doesn&#8217;t appear to have many users yet. In any case, you&#8217;ll need to have a <a href="https://getmonero.org/getting-started/choose">Monero wallet</a> and address before you can receive Moneroj.</p>
    <p><strong>Remember to Use Good Privacy Practices</strong></p>
    <p>No matter which method you use to get Monero, it&#8217;s always a good idea to use good privacy practices online. Check out our <strong>Must Read</strong> section (on the sidebar) for tutorials on how to use TOR, I2P, privacy-oriented operating systems, and other helpful privacy tips.</p>
