    <p>In April, German authorities <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/17/dark-web-vendor-chemical-love-busted-50-kg-drugs-seized/">arrested</a> five men for allegedly running the vendor shop “Chemical Love”. They were both selling drugs on the dark web and on the clearnet (the “normal” part of the internet) and had about 1,500 sales in total.</p>

    <p>Recently, German authorities carried out a major <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Neue-Razzia-nach-Zerschlagung-des-bundesweit-groessten-Drogen-Webshops-3312114.html">nationwide raid</a>, which resulted in the arrest of 63 suspects. Police believe these persons were past customers of Chemical Love. About 300 officials participated in the operation and they searched 68 homes, according to the Attorney General’s office in Koblenz. The operation took place in 11 states: Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, Lower Saxony, Thuringia, Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, North Rhine-Westphalia, Brandenburg, Berlin and Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
    <p>One of the suspects was a 38-year-old from Ingolstadt where police found 16 grams of crystal meth, a saber and several daggers. In the nationwide raid, law enforcement authorities seized about a kilogram amphetamine, 475 ecstasy pills, 40 LSD blotters, a kilogram marijuana, 6500 Euros in cash, counterfeit money worth hundreds of Euros, and other weapons (a revolver and a machete).</p>
    <p>&#8220;We were surprised that many apparently did not believe that we would look into the matter again,&#8221; Deputy Attorney General Mario Mannenweiler in Koblenz said in a statement.</p>
    <p>Since May 2015, Chemical Love scored about 1,500 sales worth at least 1.3 million Euros. They were advertising drugs both on the clearnet and on the dark web and were sending the packages via postal service. The vendor group always used bitcoins for the deals.</p>
