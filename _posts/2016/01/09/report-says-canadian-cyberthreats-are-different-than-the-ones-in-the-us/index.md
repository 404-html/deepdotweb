    <p><a href="http://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware-not-on-canadas-threat-landscape-researchers-find/article/463527/">According to a landscape report made by Trend Micro researchers, the cyberthreats in the US and in Canada are not the same.</a> Such as the United States, Canada has its own share of malware and banking trojans (such as Dridex), however, ransomware is not present in the northern country. Christopher Budd, Trend Micro’s global threat communications manager, reasoned with this statement:</p>
    <p>“For whatever reasons the market forces just aren&#8217;t driving them in that direction.”</p>
    <p>The official report did not say why such threats are not present in the country, however, according to Budd, the cost-benefit analyses by cybercriminals could show that using ransomware may have a low-yield since Canadians are not culturally attuned to falling victim such attacks. He also pointed out that ransomware attacks have ”worked their way around the globe” and their main targets were the United Kingdom and New Zealand before cybercriminals began targeting American businesses and institutes. Based on this information, Budd thinks it may be possible that Canadians will be targetted by ransomware attacks in the future.</p>
    <p>The most prominent cyberthreats to Canadian citizens are the Dridex malware and the OpenCandy adware.</p>
    <p>Cybercriminals in the US are trying to influence the Canadian threat landscape by providing the required infrastructure for hosting malicious content. The majority of infected websites that Canadians visit are mostly hosted in the US since malicious hosting in Canada simply isn&#8217;t as sophisticated as it is in other countries.</p>
    <p>According to researchers, toolkits, such as VPN services, botnets, DDoS services, are not so popular in Canada. Budd stated that Canadian cybercriminals are probably using the US infrastructure for software and toolkits:</p>
    <p>“If you have a mature marketplace where you can buy what you need there&#8217;s no need to build a new one.”</p>
    <p>The Canadian side of the dark web is mostly focusing on the sales of fake and stolen documents and information.</p>
