    <p>Seems like its the season of small exit scams, previously, a market would wait until it reaches a certain size, or accumulated a certain amount of BTC before pulling the plug and diving with everyone&#8217;s money, nowadays it seems that it just happens with the first deposit (THUG Market) or once the market manages to generate at least minor amount of popularity (EIC, allegedly).</p>
    <p>Maybe its the relative stability of the current major markets, <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay/">Alphabay</a> (<strong>1#</strong>) &amp; <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/nucleus-market/">Nucleus</a> (<strong>2#</strong>) which dominate the market and hold new markets back from getting any significant traffic until the admins just say &#8220;fuck the risk&#8221; and take whatever they can, but nobody knows for sure.</p>
    <p>Anyway, it seems that this time it was <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/east-india-company/">East India Company</a> &#8211; a market that was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/08/09/east-india-market-hacked-30-btc-gone/">hacked/exploited back in august</a>, losing 30BTC and which we had ranked as the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/16/solved-these-are-the-most-popular-dark-net-markets/">14th most popular market</a> back in November, and gained some popularity since then by implementing multisig and promoting itself, mostly on Reddit, as an exit-scam proof market (while still enabling regular escrow deposits and having only minor amount of its users using the multisig option, as reported by several vendors).</p>
    <p>For now, the market is unreachable for the past ~77 hours without any word from the admins while some reports surfaced on Reddit about coin being drained from their addresses.</p>
