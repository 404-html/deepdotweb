    <p><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-01/19/google-stop-islamic-state">According to Google, the online ”propaganda machine” of the Islamic State (ISIS) should be pushed back from public view to the dark net.</a> Jared Cohen, the director of Google Ideas, states to ”recapture digital territory” from the terrorist group, they need to make ISIS’ members fear the fact that they may be caught while posting messages on the clearnet. Cohen made these statements at a talk on ”Waging a Digital Counterinsurgency” at Chatham House:</p>
    <p>&#8220;Terrorist groups like Isis, they operate in the dark web whether we want them to or not. What is new is that they&#8217;re operating without being pushed back in the same internet we all enjoyed. So success looks like Isis being contained to the dark web.”</p>
    <p>&#8220;The reality is what Isis is doing with technology ranges from communication to spamming, to all sorts of tactics that you&#8217;re probably more familiar with fraud and spam and various scams you&#8217;ve received in your inbox.&#8221;</p>
    <p>He also added: &#8220;To me Isis is not a tech savvy organisation.&#8221;</p>
    <p>According to the Google Ideas director, if the Islamic State would be forced back to the dark net, it would decrease the spread of the organization’s propaganda content among people. Also, deleting ISIS-associated social media accounts at a faster rate could end up with a much harder contact between people and ISIS recruiters.</p>
    <p>An analysis has been made in 2014, which shows the group&#8217;s online activity as they routinely hijack hashtags, use bots, and post brutal videos to social media websites, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
    <p>The cyber unit of the United Kingdom’s counter-terrorist unit states that they remove 1,000 illegal pieces of terrorism-related content from the internet each week. The analysis also says that roughly 800 of these contents are coming from Syria and Iraq. The task force claims that in the 12 months time frame before June 2012 that 39,000 internet takedowns were completed.</p>
    <p>Schools have been warned by the threat of &#8220;small minority of users who exploit social media to radicalise and recruit vulnerable people&#8221;.</p>
    <p>However, according to Shiraz Maher, a radicalisation researcher from King&#8217;s College London, UK citizens who want to join the Islamic State use the Telegram app for encryption. Telegram is currently in the phase of removing those public channels from their application that were promoting ISIS.</p>
    <p>Another possible tactic, according to Yasmin Green of Google Ideas, is to show targeted advertising to those who have been identified as looking at the propaganda.</p>
