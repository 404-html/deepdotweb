    <p>Montgomery Richard Kyle Byrne (31) from Bury <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/montgomery-byrne-jailed-dark-web-10743557">was busted by the National Crime Agency (NCA)</a> when he attempted to hand over £1,300 to buy a Glock pistol and 300 rounds of ammunition at a motorway service station. Byrne has been sentenced for up to 6 years of prison at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to to nine firearms offences, including possessing a bolt action rifle and “a quantity of cartridges with bullets designed to explode on or immediately before contact”.</p>

    <p>The man tried to set up a deal on the dark web, however, he was caught by the law enforcement authorities when he wanted to to hand over £1,300 in cash for a live fire Glock 9mm semi-automatic handgun and 300 rounds of ammunition that he&#8217;d bought online.</p>
    <p>According to the NCA, Byrne also tried to buy an AK 47 from the dark web. During the man&#8217;s house raid, authorities found a Smitt Ruben hunting (or sniper) rifle, as well as a sawn-off shotgun, a revolver and more than 200 rounds of ammunition, including cartridges and bullets.</p>
    <p>Law enforcements also seized an ammunition press, firearms powder, bullet heads and percussion caps. These are all components for producing ammunition that could be used by various weapons.</p>
    <p>Brent Lyon, a member of the NCA’s Armed Operations Unit, said Byrne was caught after he left a “digital footprint”:</p>
    <p>“Byrne does not have any identifiable links to organized crime or terrorism but the weapons he was attempting to buy and the ones he already possessed could have caused significant harm. If you buy guns on the dark web you leave a digital footprint – and the NCA will do everything it can to identify you and hold you to account.”</p>
