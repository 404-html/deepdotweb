    <p><strong>The Company</strong></p>
    <p>In this Mullvad Review we found out that Mullvad is a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/vpn-comparison-chart/">VPN service</a> operated by Amagicom AB Company based in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. Mullvad’s mission is to make the internet censorship and surveillance ineffective. Mullvad endeavors to keep your online activity, location and identity private. Its location in Sweden gives it a head start over other VPN service providers. In Sweden, the EU Data Retention Directive (DRD) did not apply to VPN providers during implantation which makes Sweden an ideal place to locate servers and also operate VPN services. Luck of censorship makes Sweden a haven for internet users who need privacy.</p>
    <p><strong>Free Trial and Money back guarantee</strong></p>
    <p>Mullvad understands that most potential VPN customers wish to run a test to find out whether the VPN they are eager to purchase gives the kind of protection they need. Mullvad allows 3 hours’ free trial for anyone who would like to test it before making a purchase. Mullvad gave us an option of creating a new trial account or using an existing account.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13068" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1-1.png" alt="1" width="578" height="349" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1-1.png 578w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1-1-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></p>
    <p>Though the free trial might seem short it’s invaluable to anyone who needs assurance before purchasing. To access free Mullvad all you only have is to create a new trial account. When comparing the review of Mullvad to others, the 3 hours is pretty short.</p>

    <p>The company stays true to their privacy pledge such that we were not required to give our name or email address to download the client software. We were only required to complete CAPTCHA verification, and an account was automatically created.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13069" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-6.jpg" alt="2" width="1007" height="1019" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-6.jpg 1007w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-6-296x300.jpg 296w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-6-55x55.jpg 55w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-6-50x50.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /></p>
    <p>Mullvad gave us various payment options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Bitcoin</li>
    <li>Cash</li>
    <li>Bankwire</li>
    <li>PayPal</li>
    <li>Credit card</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13070" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3-6.jpg" alt="3" width="1007" height="795" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3-6.jpg 1007w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3-6-300x237.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /></p>
    <p>Whenever a service provider offers money &#8211; back guarantee, it means that they are confident of their service and are willing to refund customers who find their service to be below the stated standard. Unfortunately, Mullvad doesn’t have money &#8211; back guarantee which is a big letdown for a company that promises total anonymity and security.</p>
    <p><strong>Interface and setup</strong></p>
    <p>For an accurate Mullvad review we made sure to download the client software that suited our operating system. They provide options for Window, OSX, and Linux. Androids are also supported using OPEN VPN for Android and PPTP while iOS is supported by using PPTP. Our device was windows based and so we selected on windows download.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13071" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-4.jpg" alt="4" width="1007" height="1042" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-4.jpg 1007w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-4-290x300.jpg 290w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-4-990x1024.jpg 990w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /></p>
    <p>We were directed to Mullvad 57 setup wizard and begun the installation.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13072" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-2.png" alt="5" width="713" height="502" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-2.png 713w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-2-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
    <p>Their interface is simple and easy to use.</p>
    <p>After the download was complete, we ran the software by clicking on the install button.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13073" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-2.png" alt="6" width="604" height="467" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-2.png 604w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-2-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
    <p>The Mullvad software was installed on our device very fast. Mullvad is a sure winner when it comes to setup. This factor has endeared it to many clients, unlike many of its competitors with complex software’s that require technical skills or even customer support assistance to install. With Mullvad, we just downloaded and installed the software and we were ready to go.</p>
    <p>The client connects to a server of its choice. You are also able to change to any other server.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13074" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7-1.png" alt="7" width="600" height="672" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7-1.png 600w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7-1-268x300.png 268w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
    <p>The main screen provides the user with basic information</p>
    <p>The settings screen allows the user to switch on the features of the client.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You can change account number</li>
    <li>Manage your account</li>
    <li>Block the internet on connection failure</li>
    <li>Stop DNS leaks</li>
    <li>IPV6 Provides IPV6 tunneling</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13075" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/8.png" alt="8" width="494" height="611" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/8.png 494w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/8-243x300.png 243w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
    <p>When Mullvad is connected and working correctly, an icon appears in the notification bar displaying a green tick.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13076" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/9-1.jpg" alt="9" width="193" height="65" /></p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>During our review of Mullvad VPN we discovered that it provides a custom open VPN client to protect its users against attack vectors such as leaks through DNS, IPV6, and Teredo. Mullvad does not obey the EU Data Retention Directive (DRD). They don’t disclose anything, and they also don’t log their user’s activities thus even if they are required to divulge information about their customers, they can’t for they don’t have any information stored. They employ 2048 – bit RSA and 128-bit Blowfish open VPN encryption that is ideal for stopping any spying on users’ data. Though not the highest standard encryption, Mullvad is totally committed to your security. They have a DNS leak protection that ensures your actual IP address is not revealed.</p>
    <p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>Our Mullvad review found that the service is pretty good for those who need total privacy. They don’t ask for any personal information from users, not even an email address. Since it’s located in Sweden, it is not required to cooperate with Swedish law enforcement. Unlike other ISP and VPN service providers, Mullvad doesn’t keep detailed logs of your online activities thus a third party cannot match an IP Address and a time stamp to its users.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13077" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10-1.jpg" alt="10" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10-1.jpg 600w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10-1-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
    <p>Mullvad does not respond to DMCA policy. The good thing with Mullvad is that all their internet traffic is protected. However, users should be careful not to expose their IP with WebRTC. WebRTC allows Mullvad users to have video and audio communications without any plugging installed, which could lead to your IP being exposed. Mullvad official website confirms that the issue is present in Windows, Linux, Android, and OSX, but it’s not evident in iOS.</p>
    <p>Mullvad has a “Kill Switch” which blocks internet traffic if the VPN is disconnected unexpectedly, protecting the real IP address exposure. What an advantage!</p>
    <p><strong>Speed</strong></p>
    <p>Speed is of utmost importance for internet users. A slow speed is greatly inconveniencing and annoying. Mullvad exhibits relatively good speed, especially on P2P. However, Speed is determined by many factors, the best way of testing the speed is by connecting with their client software.</p>
    <p>The servers in European locations are faster than in the US. On a 100Mbps connection, Torrent downloads reach between 70 to 90 mbps on European locations while on the US locations speeds of 20 to 40 mbps are evident. On speedtest.net you get speeds of slightly over 50 mbps. Some computers experience packet loss problems with Open VPN over UDP resulting to very slow speeds. The best way to remedy this is to make the tunnel run over TCP instead. Go to Advanced in settings and set protocol = tcp in the [client] section.</p>
    <p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
    <p>Mullvad is a user-friendly VPN, you can connect and disconnect it anytime. Another good thing that keeps it ahead of the pack is the fact that you can adjust settings without contacting customer care; thus, saving valuable time. The software is also easy to setup and to get started.</p>
    <p><strong>Features</strong></p>
    <p>The website is well structured and user-friendly. The website does not use external resources such as Google Analytics. Their servers use Open VPN which is exactly what you need if combining it with Tor on the Deep Web, which is renowned for creating secure service point &#8211; to- point connections. Open VPN is an open source and has been extensively tested for security purposes. Mullvad offers unlimited bandwidth that’s ideal for customers who stream a lot.</p>

They are also comfortable with cash being sent in an envelope to the company’s headquarters. The letter sent anonymously can ensure buyers anonymity.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13078" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11.png" alt="11" width="1024" height="369" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11.png 1024w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
    <p>Mullvad payment system is pretty cool; they accept crypto currency notably bitcoin. You get a bitcoin address that you use to fill up your desired amount and get a corresponding access time. Your account is randomly generated, and you can at any time generate a new payment address. Pricing is competitive, and they also give a discount for paying with bitcoin. Paying with bitcoin is cheaper due to lower fees and minimal administration. To see how much is left; you can visit the account management page. Alternatively, you can select account management in settings.</p>

    <p><strong>Support</strong></p>
    <p>The Mullvad website is simple and elaborate<strong>. </strong>It covers all the necessary areas with proper explanation. It has FAQ page that covers the most important questions users normally ask. Mullvad provides an email address supported by PGP encryption. The response is quick, knowledgeable and usually takes about two hours. They do not have a live chat, which can be very helpful for one &#8211; on &#8211; one communication.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>To sum up our Mullvad review, Mullvad is a small company that has prioritized privacy. Their VPN setup is easy to use, and no personal information is requested. They don’t keep logs so that even if requested by the court to divulge information they have none. The free trial on offer lasts for three hours. Mullvad has good speeds especially for p2p, but they need to improve on the speed in the USA. They accept bitcoin payment as well as cash, and they also have a quick and helpful support team. Pricing is very competitive compared to other VPN service providers.</p>
    <p>Mullvad needs to locate more servers for global coverage. They should incorporate live chat and IM options to strengthen their support mechanism. All in all, Mullvad service is of high quality and there’s still room for improvement.</p>
