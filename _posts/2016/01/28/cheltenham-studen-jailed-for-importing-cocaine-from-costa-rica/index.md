    <p>Jordan Richards-Chiverton (22), a Cheltenham university student, imported <a href="http://www.gloucestershireecho.co.uk/Cheltenham-student-jailed-importing-cocaine-Costa/story-28599085-detail/story.html">£500 worth of cocaine from a dark net vendor located in Costa Rica</a>, which resulted in 2 years of jail sentence given by Gloucester Crown Court. According to official documents, the man made the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/dark-net-market-comparison-chart/">dark web</a> deal on August/September 2014.</p>
    <p>However, the package raised the postal workers&#8217; suspicion in Coventry, which was followed by the local police catching the parcel. When Richards-Chiverton went to the postal office to collect his package, the law enforcement authorities have busted him on September 9, 2014.</p>
    <p>The man confessed “attempting to evade the prohibition on the importation of cocaine” and was sentenced by Recorder Paul Grumbar.</p>
    <p>According to Grumbar, there were no evidence that Richards-Chiverton was dealing with drugs. He also made this statement:</p>
    <p>&#8220;I cannot put out of my mind the fact that there is evidence as to how you got started with all this. It seems to be that despite all the evidence your counsel has drawn to my attention that you were a hard working, studious and promising young man that essentially you gave into greed and thought this was an easy way of making money.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Ekwall Singh-Tiwana, from defense, tried to convince the court to pass a suspended sentence so Richards-Chiverton could continue his studies and help to support his mother since she has serious health issues. However, Recorder Grumbar said the case was too serious for “anything other than an immediate jail term.”</p>
    <p>According to prosecutor Julian Kesner, the intercepted package contained 13.5 grams of cocaine worth between the price of £420 and £560.</p>
    <p>When the police busted the student&#8217;s home, they found digital scales, a laptop and a diary containing a &#8216;dealer&#8217;s list&#8217; of purchases and amounts. Recorder Grumbar made these additional statements regarding the case:</p>
    <p>&#8220;The laptop showed how he had made this purchase &#8211; using the dark web where guns, ammunition and drugs are sold by criminals over the internet. Bitcoin was used for payment, not cash. He had the username &#8216;Luigi&#8217;. This is the very first case I have been involved in where the dark web and bitcoin are used.&#8221;</p>
