    <p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/30/yahoo-announces-500m-accounts-compromised/">DeepDotWeb reported Yahoo announced 500 million accounts were compromised</a> by what the company claimed to be a “state-sponsored actor”. Back then all affect users were notified and the problem appeared to be swept under the rug.</p>
    <p>Now, <a href="https://investor.yahoo.net/ReleaseDetail.cfm?&amp;ReleaseID=1004285">Yahoo issued a press release in which it states more than 1 billion user accounts were compromised</a> – and sensitive information was stolen. According to the company, phone numbers, birthdates, security questions and even hashed passwords (using MD5). The hack occurred back in August 2013. The company’s investigation indicates credit card data and bank account information was not stolen.</p>
    <p>The internet giant claims forensic experts found out a third party gained access to the company’s proprietary code, which it then used to forge cookies. All affected users are personally being notified by the company, after it already invalidated the forged cookies. The press release also claims the suspect is the same state-sponsored actor responsible for the hack that compromised 500 million user accounts.</p>
    <p>If 1 billion accounts were indeed compromised by the hacker(s), then this is the biggest breach ever, beating those that affect companies such <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/myspace-hack-password-dump/">as MySpace</a> that compromised 360 million user accounts and saw 427 million passwords being sold online.</p>
    <p>The company advises its users to review their security information in order to make sure they’ll be safe, even if some of their personal information was compromised. Users notified by Yahoo were also warned not to open suspicious links or download attachments from suspicious emails, even if they mention personal information. Affected users can <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/SLN27925.html?impressions=true">find answers to their questions using this link</a>.</p>
    <p>At the end of the press release, the company tells users it recommends the use of the <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN25781.html">Yahoo Account Key</a>, their security system that eliminates the need for a password to login. A lot of users may, however, delete their accounts.</p>
    <p><strong>Yahoo’s deal with Verizon may be affected</strong></p>
    <p>Back in July <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-acquires-yahoo-2016-7">Yahoo was sold to Verizon for $4.8 billion</a>, as it was to be merged with AOL. When the 500 million user account hack was announced, Verizon clearly stated the deal wasn’t as valuable as it was before that information was made public. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/report-verizon-wants-1-billion-discount-after-yahoo-privacy-concerns/">company reportedly wanted a $1 billion discount on the deal</a> due to privacy concerns at the time.</p>
    <p>The company had been struggling financially for a few years, as it failed to understand what exactly was its core goal on the internet, even though it had over 1 billion users. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was a former Google employee <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/25/technology/yahoo-marissa-mayer-what-went-wrong/">that failed to save the company in recent years</a>.</p>
    <p>At the time, Verizon told CNBC the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>As we’ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Verizon’s reaction to the new information has not yet been made public, so we’ll all need to wait in order to know what the telecommunications giant will do.</p>
    <p>At the time of press, Yahoo’s stock value (YHOO) had gone down by roughly 5% as the news spread across the web.</p>
