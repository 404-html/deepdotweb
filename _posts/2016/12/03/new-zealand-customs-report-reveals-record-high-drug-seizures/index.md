    <p>New Zealand Customs Report Reveals Record High Drug Seizures</p>
    <p>According to recent reports from New Zealand Customs, drug seizures are at an all time high. The reports covered the first eight months of the year. Thus far, Customs seized 15% more packages than in 2015. Fourfold the number of packages in 2014.</p>
    <p>The Official Information Act by Customs revealed more than seizure numbers. Drug trends—both increases and decreases—were noted. Yet, officials were unsure if New Zealand was a destination country or a transit country. Or even an export country.</p>

    <p>New Zealand Drug Foundation (NZDF) executive director Ross Bell said evaluation involved many factors. &#8220;Are we a transit country or a destination country or an export country—No-one knows if that half-tonne of meth was coming in or whether it was going out,&#8221; he said. Bell referred to the discovery of 500 kilograms of methamphetamine earlier this year. Police interviewed people near Northland beach where beach-goers found the meth. Further investigation by many law enforcement agencies still provided no answers.</p>

    <p>This year, <a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/drug-seizures-hit-record-high">Customs seized &#8220;more than&#8221; 360 kilograms of methamphetamine</a> in various packages. Stimulant seizures in general increased, the figures showed. Cocaine and ecstasy increased slightly. Ephedrine, a stimulant on its own but more commonly used in the manufacturing of meth, became far more prevalent. Customs seized &#8220;more than&#8221; 760 kilograms of ephedrine this year. This set yet another record for the country.</p>
    <p>Ephedrine influx seemed to have an inverse relationship with actual meth consumption. The Ministry of Health’s latest Drug Harm Index report showed there were 388,000 users of drugs in New Zealand, but the vast majority used cannabis. However, methamphetamine users were at an all time low. New Zealand, several years ago, was &#8220;seen as one of the world’s highest users of meth&#8221;.</p>
    <p>The<a href="https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/methamphetamine/drug-trends"> 2014/15 Health Survey report on amphetamine</a> (predominantly methamphetamine) use published in 2015 found:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>0.9% of people aged 16-64 used amphetamines in the past 12 months.</em></li>
    <li><em>Amphetamine use was most commonly reported by people aged 25-34 years (1.4%) but is still used by the younger 16-24 year old age group (1.3%).</em></li>
    <li><em>The mean age of people who had used amphetamine in the past 12 months was 33 years.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Global Drug Survey 2017 will be <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/24/global-drug-survey-2017-will-highlight-darknet-drug-users-worldwide/">collecting similar data</a>, we previously reported. However, it aims to focus on darknet drug users, specifically.</p>
    <p>Ross said the 2016 meth usage in New Zealand was around 500 kilograms. He mentioned that the data was not easy to come and the number estimated by the NZDF was just that—an estimate. He added that drugs were becoming more common in small towns. But, in large urban cities, drug use was less common. Compared to six years ago, this was not the case; drug use in urban centers ran rampant.</p>
    <p>The strangest trend, he said, was the influx of new, &#8220;synthetic&#8221; drugs. (Note: he spoke of various research chemicals and &#8220;synthetic&#8221; drugs synonymously.) &#8220;What we have at the moment is a whole lot of chemicals that are being cooked up. Probably very dangerous chemicals. And are being made to mimic older more well-known drugs,&#8221; he said.</p>
    <p>He said Customs saw various NBOMes, &#8220;a psychedelic drug designed to mimic LSD.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;These are being bought online and being brought into the country through the black market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People buying these drugs don’t really know what they are taking. They are getting themselves into trouble. They are putting themselves at huge risk of overdose.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;There is significant health risks,’’ he explained. Ross said there was never a way to know if a &#8220;synthetic drug&#8221; was lethal or not. &#8220;We had a death earlier this year &#8230; from these new drugs,&#8221; he said.</p>
    <p>Ross concluded with acknowledgement that law enforcement had gotten better since last year. It had additional resources. These two components were key to the number of seizures conducted by customs in 2016.</p>
