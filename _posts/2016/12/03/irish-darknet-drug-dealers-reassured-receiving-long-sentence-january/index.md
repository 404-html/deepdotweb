    <p>The three Irishmen who were charged for selling drugs on the Darknet have been assured they will receive lengthy jail sentences for their crimes.</p>
    <p>Richard Sinclair of Coleraine, Kyle Hall of Belfast, and Stephen Rodgers of Carrickfergus were all arrested and charged for <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/22/three-irishman-stand-trial-dark-net-drug-dealing/">selling drugs using the Darknet</a>. Sinclair allegedly used his bedroom computer to order drugs from Holland, and redistribute them in DVD cases. Hall was also busted using his own home for a similar venture. The courts are considering Rodgers as a mere patsy in the operations.</p>
    <p>Sinclair plead guilty to the charges of possessing class A drugs with the intent to supply, and importing class A drugs. Hall plead guilty to a range of similar charges; while Rodgers plead guilty to being concerned in the supply of class A, B, and C drugs as well as converting criminal property.</p>
    <p>Belfast Crown court stated that the operation was sophisticated, and commercial in its size; earning several hundred thousand pounds.</p>
    <p>Sinclair’s defense attorney stated that his client gave a full admission of guilt during initial interviews and questioning, and that he:</p>
    <p><em>Actively assisted police in their enquiries to the extent of his offending and role, and deserves significant credit for that. He admitted at the interview to very serious offences. He is ashamed and remorseful. </em></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16728 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/word-image-15.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/word-image-15.jpeg 660w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/word-image-15-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
    <p>Hall’s defense said that his role was selling morphine with the intent to supply; and also, stated that Hall was not standing on street corners peddling drugs in the community. Rodger’s defense also had a word in court, stating that his client once had a bright future, and a promising career but it all went south when he became addicted to drugs, but that his client was considerably supportive with investigations.</p>
    <p>The judge told both Sinclair and Hall that they were going to receive substantial stays behind bars for their involvement in what he called “<em>the scourge that brought the drugs into society.”</em></p>
    <p>The judge also added that there was a considerable volume of paperwork needed to be considered, and while it was being considered he would allow the three men to have a bail. The three men are scheduled to appear back in court on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2017 for sentencing.</p>
    <p>Fears are mounting as more and more users from the Darknet are being busted. Headline after headline appear in news feeds and updates daily. Bulk sellers, as well as small time buyers are all being targeted. Once more <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/14/uk-watchdog-files-gchq-european-court-human-justice/">governments adopt the strict surveillance laws</a> we are seeing lately in the UK, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/24/tor-joined-fight-stop-upcoming-changes-rule-41/">and December 1<sup>st</sup> in the U.S</a>, it is unclear where the fate of Darknet users will end up; but one thing is certain. Day by day all of our online rights to privacy are being spread really thin, almost to the point of being non-existent all together.</p>
