    <p>In August, Canada Border Service <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/18/police-intercept-package-mail-containing-1kg-carfentanil/">announced the seizure of a carfentanil package</a>. Governments worldwide recognized that the hyper-potent, fentanyl fully-synthetic opioid was a considerable threat. The darknet drew media attention as the initial &#8220;source&#8221; of the chemical.</p>
    <p>China was then recognized to be the real source. But Canadian officials believe that China may not be easy to work with.</p>
    <p>“Cocaine or heroin, we know what the purpose is,” said Allan Lai, an officer-in-charge at RCMP. “With respect to carfentanil, we don’t know why a substance of that potency is coming into our country.”</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/news/national/rcmp+looks+overseas+stop+flow+drugs+reliable+china+partner/12434044/story.html">RCMP announced a readiness to work with China</a>. But the announcement was not made without doubt. &#8220;China’s reliability as a partner in the fight against the deadly opioid is far from certain,&#8221; a <em>Vancouver Sun</em> journalist reported.</p>
    <p>In October 2015, China added 116 substances to the controlled substances list. Of the the 116 substances, many were opioids and opiates. Some were various fentanyl derivatives. Yet, carfentanil was not on that list. “but the drugs that made it to Canada are not controlled in China,” Assistant Commissioner Todd Shean told the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health.</p>
    <p>“Fentanyl abuse has not been identified in China,” he continued. “The Chinese government’s focus is on other synthetic drugs of abuse like methamphetamine and ketamine.”</p>
    <p>The US <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/15/us-government-concerned-carfentanil-chemical-weapon/">DEA agreed with Canada</a> in one sense. Numerous press releases, issued by DEA officials, report China as the main supplier. Dennis Wichern of the DEA’s Chicago Field Division spoke about carfentanil in China. “They recognize they have a problem with the synthetic drug explosion, as I call it,” he said. “The Chinese are all aboard. They’ve outlawed it. We’re working with them. We have agents on the ground every day in Beijing and Hong Kong working with the Chinese to stop this.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/04/authorities-push-legislation-aims-end-shipping-drugs-via-usps/">US State senators agreed</a>. Recently, Sen. Rob Portman delivered a Senate floor speech. There, he pushed his USPS legislation that, he said, would end incoming drug trade. He, along with three supporting senators, were in agreement about China. “It [carfentanil] comes from our postal system and [China’s] postal system into the United States. Unbelievable — the poison is coming in the mail to our communities,” said Portman.</p>
    <p>In stark contrast, an RCMP official told a committee that Canada and China disagree. Neither country saw &#8220;eye to eye&#8221; in respect to the [car]fentanyl threat. He said there was a “disparity between what Canada and China consider a public health crisis.”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16716 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/11/fa183787a2e74f0680ae345483543fa4-fa183787a2e74f068.jpeg" alt="fa183787a2e74f0680ae345483543fa4-fa183787a2e74f0680ae345483543fa4-0.jpg" width="690" height="516" srcset="/imgs/2016/11/fa183787a2e74f0680ae345483543fa4-fa183787a2e74f068.jpeg 960w, /imgs/2016/11/fa183787a2e74f0680ae345483543fa4-fa183787a2e74f068-300x224.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></p>
    <p>Sgt. Luc Chicoine, the RCMP’s national drug program coordinator, said that Canada will help China. He said that Canada will press China to add more substances to the controlled substance list. China acknowledged the worldwide concern. But the size and population makes the law difficult to enforce, Chicoine reported.</p>
    <p>Chicoine said &#8220;China has a desire to move forward and step away from being always the one that everybody’s pointing the finger at.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The US mainstream media reported carfentanil-related deaths as the first one occurred. But, Canada, too, faces their own carfentanil crisis, the RCMP announced. Vancouver police announced that carfentanil may have been in circulation throughout Vancouver.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16717 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/11/carfentanil-jpg-jpeg.jpeg" alt="carfentanil-jpg.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2016/11/carfentanil-jpg-jpeg.jpeg 620w, /imgs/2016/11/carfentanil-jpg-jpeg-300x194.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
    <p>&#8220;Canadian dealers typically purchase their orders on the Internet over the &#8216;dark web.&#8217; [Car]Fentanyl is usually imported in powdered form. Then mixed in Canada and pressed into tablet form,&#8221; an RCMP official reported.</p>
    <p>During his testimony, Shean explained that identifying the drug was not easy. Shean described the &#8220;printer ink&#8221; cartridges that carfentanil was often disguised in. Toys and DVDs too.</p>
    <p>The RCMP distributed 13,000 naloxone spray kits across the country to fight the epidemic. Naloxone works well to flush normal opioids out of a human&#8217;s opioid receptors. The anti-overdose drug saves lives on a daily basis. Against carfentanil, though, Naloxone may not be potent enough. Carfentanil&#8217;s opioid receptor affinity is not shared with normal opioids.</p>
