    <p>The Chief of Criminal Investigation in Bremerhaven spoke to a reporter about the intricate difficulties of her job. Her job, Karina Görs said, was hunting down pedophiles on the internet. She specifically focused on tracking pedophiles on the darknet.</p>
    <p>She told <em>Nord 24</em> (<em>North 24</em>) that on a daily basis she sifted through hundreds of pictures and videos. <a href="http://nord24.de/blaulicht/massen-verstoerender-bilder-sind-ihr-job-die-polizistin-karina-goers-ermittelt-kinderpornografische-delikte">The content seen was beyond disturbing</a>. Viewing the images was something Görs hated doing. She said that she was not prepared for the first pictures she found on the darknet. &#8220;I sometimes still have them in my head, even now,&#8221; she told the interviewer. &#8220;One must be prepared to deal with the worst.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;This is a work that can only be done voluntarily,&#8221; said the 45-year-old investigator. &#8220;If you have young children, I would not recommend it.&#8221; Görs own children are 17 and 18 years old. &#8220;If you have a three-year-old infant at home, you suffer differently from it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Görs started working with police in 1990. She had a passion for protecting children that served as her drive. Her goal was to become even better at her job. In 1996, she underwent a specialized Kripo screening process. Only a small number of Kriminalpolizei officers (Criminal Police) pass the rigorous examination. Those who pass proceed to pursue technical education at a police academy. After completing the course, officers then serve a three-year apprenticeship under superior officers. Afterwards, the officers can become a full-time criminal investigator.</p>
    <p>After she became a criminal investigator, she moved to Bremerhaven in 2003. She said that she had investigated pedophiles on the darknet for five years. Since the start of her career, she said the number of child pornography cases multiplied. The reason for the growth, she explained, was not a complicated one. Internet-based child pornography became more prevalent. Darknet rings and groups spread more quickly. They grew in accessibility.</p>
    <p>Pedophiles mainly exchange the explicit media on the darknet, she said. &#8220;As a rule, you do not come across child pornography when surfing the net.&#8221;</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16725 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1456740138268728-jpg.jpeg" alt="1456740138268728.jpg" width="737" height="496" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1456740138268728-jpg.jpeg 1040w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1456740138268728-jpg-300x202.jpeg 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1456740138268728-jpg-1024x689.jpeg 1024w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1456740138268728-jpg-290x195.jpeg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /></p>
    <p>Law enforcement world-wide noticed the darknet&#8217;s draw for pedopiles. Investigators busted many notable child pornography sites in the recent past. Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/20/police-infiltrated-darknet-forum-hunt-pedophiles/">Taskforce Argos took down The Love Zone</a>. And, with it, Britain&#8217;s &#8220;worst pedophile.&#8221; Authorities arrested hundreds of users as a result. And FBI investigators brought down PlayPen—another notorious child pornography shop. The <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/02/largest-deepweb-child-porn-distributor-fbi/">results of the PlayPen investigation</a> were, however, controversial.</p>
    <p>“We know that individuals are abusing online platforms and networks to distribute child sexual abuse material and are determined to target them and bring them to justice,” said Steven Wilson, head of Europol’s EC3 Cybercrime Operations.</p>
    <p>Görs said that 20 cases of child pornography are recorded in Bremerhaven police every year. &#8220;The search for child pornography is already punishable,&#8221; said the investigator. However, she added, Bremerhaven has often needed outside assistance in catching darknet pedophiles. &#8220;The Federal Criminal Police Office evaluates 250 daily suspects from the USA and passes them on to us,&#8221; Görs said. &#8220;Many of the suspects have ties to Bremerhaven with spider-net-like connections lead to other federal states.&#8221; The BKA often handled those cases, she explained.</p>
    <p><em>Not infrequently, the investigators encounter masses of prohibited material. 500 000 pictures and 10,000 to 20,000 videos per offender are not unusual. The perpetrators feed their imagination. The sexual imprinting will remain, the offender can only learn to live with it.</em></p>
    <p>As long as the darknet has child pornography websites, Görs will continue to investigate child pornography online. &#8220;What drives me? The successes to capture offenders,&#8221; she concluded.</p>
