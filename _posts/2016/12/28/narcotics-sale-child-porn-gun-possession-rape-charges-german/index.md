    <p>A 37-year-old man from Fahrenzhausen, Germany has been <a href="http://www.wochenblatt.de/nachrichten/freising/regionales/Waffen-Potenzmittel-und-Vergewaltigungen;art1178,410746">charged</a> with serious crimes including the possession of three handguns, child porn, the distribution of drugs on the internet and the rape of his ex-girlfriend.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17195 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/process-weapon-potenzmittel-rape.jpeg" alt="Process Weapon Potenzmittel Rape" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/process-weapon-potenzmittel-rape.jpeg 592w, /imgs/2016/12/process-weapon-potenzmittel-rape-300x157.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"/></p>
    <p><a id="post-17191-_gjdgxs"></a> Court documents say that the accused was involved in the dark net scene since 2013. Firstly, investigators were on the wrong trail, they were tracing the purchase of a machine gun, however, it led to a man from Baden-Württemberg (who was a suspect in another case). When law enforcement authorities finally tracked down the 37-year-old, they found an arsenal of firearms in his apartment. In October 2015, police seized three fully functioning semi-automatic Glock 17, Glock 19 and Glock 26 pistols, a handle and a silencer for a Glock 17 <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/handgun/">handgun</a>. Also, 90 rounds of ammunition were discovered by the authorities.</p>
    <p>According to police information, the 37-year-old purchased all firearms from the dark web, which were shipped as separate parts to the man’s apartment. He invested about 4,000 euros in the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/weapon/">weapons</a>. The charges include the illicit acquisition of nine essential components of semi-automatic short-armament, the unauthorized possession of three semi-automatic short weapons, and the illegal acquisition and possession of ammunition.</p>
    <p>In addition to that, the suspect is also accused of the commercial production and marketing of counterfeit medicines in 89 cases. The 37-year-old ran a shop on the internet (clearnet or dark net, it is unclear) where he advertised and sold Maxidus, an unauthorized herbal potency agent from January 2014 to May 2015. The prosecution claims the man sent out about 3,900 capsules to his customers by mail and scored 6,000 euros in total. However, the Maxidus pills were fake, the 37-year-old crushed Viagra tablets and mixed it with cocoa powder in gelatin capsules.</p>
    <p>During the home search, detectives seized the hard drives and the mobile phones of the suspect where forensic experts found 33 images and seven video files containing youth porn and 127 pictures and 40 videos of child pornography material.</p>
    <p>When officers examined the iPad of the suspect, they found other incriminating evidence too. The investigation showed that the 37-year-old has sexually assaulted his 31-year-old ex-girlfriend in November 2011, June 2012, January 2013 and November 2013. The accused made videos of their sexual intercourses.</p>
    <p>Prosecution charged the suspect with four cases of sexual abuse of incapacitated persons by means of pictures, the possession of youth pornographic contents in 38 cases, and possession of child pornographic contents in 167 cases.</p>
    <p>During the trial, the accused confessed his crimes with the help of his defender Robert Alavi who managed to agree on four to five years in prison for his client. The lawyer said that the 37-year-old had already apologized to his ex-girlfriend for his deeds and claimed that there were no drugs involved during the sexual intercourse. He also stated that his client was selling <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/narcotics/">narcotics</a> to clear his financial problems and was not aware that he was violating the German drug laws. The accused also claimed that child and youth porn on his computer had been saved years ago and he had forgotten about the data. The 37-year-old said that he ordered the weapons for self-defense only, he did not plan to harm anyone. He added that the firearms were in his possession to resort the means of suicide.</p>
    <p>Despite the agreement, the Chamber continues the investigation, with a verdict to be announced soon.</p>
