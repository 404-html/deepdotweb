    <p>An investigation conducted by <a href="http://www.littlehamptongazette.co.uk/news/crime/county-news-two-charged-with-drugs-offences-following-dark-web-investigation-1-7708028">South East Regional Organized Crime</a> (SEROCU) led to the arrest of four men for darknet crimes. SEROCU investigated four men: two from Sussex and two from Birmingham. The Crawley Magistrates’ Court has seen only the Sussex men. The other two faced charges in Birmingham. Police confirmed that the court formally charged the two Sussex men with a string of darknet-related drug offenses.</p>
    <p>The first Sussex suspect was Myles Cirjanic-Edwards, a 25-year-old from The Boulevard, Crawley. The court charged Cirjanic-Edwards with six offenses:</p>

    <p>And the second Sussex man was Ahmet Ciftdal, a 26-year-old from East Grinstead. The court charged Ciftdal with nine drug-related crimes:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/09/national-cyber-security-centre-opens-hq-london-set-government-firewalls/">SEROCU began their investigation</a> with the Proceeds of Crime Act in scope. They suspected the group of money laundering through the internet. Throughout the course of the investigation, detectives stumbled upon the so-called “ring.” The group of four, investigators said, potentially offered money laundering services via darknet marketplaces. As the investigation proceeded, the police noticed drug-related activities.</p>
    <p>Per the authorities, the group supplied drugs over the darknet. Class A and Class B drugs. The court mentioned cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, and ketamine.</p>
    <p>The court released all four men on bail until their sentencing on Thursday, December 29.</p>
