    <p>On December 7, the MalwareHunterTeam, a company which operates a popular platform called CyberTracker, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-scheme-spread-popcorn-time-ransomware-get-chance-of-free-decryption-key/">discovered</a> a first-of-its-kind <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/06/europol-report-ransomware-presenting-biggest-cyber-threat/">ransomware</a> that grants a free decryption key to a victim that successfully infects two more people with the same ransomware.</p>
    <p>Conventionally, when a victim or a computer operator is infected with ransomware, its creators demand a ransom for an <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/08/encryptor-raas-operator-shuts-website-deletes-decryption-master-key/">decryption</a> key to gain access again to the files of the infected computer. Once a payment is accepted&#8211;usually settled in digital currencies like bitcoin for increased anonymity&#8211;the hacker provides a decryption key or directly decrypts the files of the computer.</p>
    <p>However, newly designed ransomware called Popcorn Time forces victims to pass the malware to people around in order to save their files, computers and infected devices. More importantly, any victim that tries to guess the decryption code will see their files deleted after 4 failed attempts.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17043 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-85.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-85.png 925w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-85-300x37.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px"/></p>
    <p>The hacking group or the creators of the Popcorn Time ransomware offers two choices to their victims; either to pay 1 bitcoin to their bitcoin address and regain access to their computers in about 3 hours (2 hours of confirmation and 1 hour of payment verification on the blockchain) or to send an Onion link to people through messaging applications, emails or by web links to infect two more people.</p>
    <p>The latter, which the hacking group describes as the “nasty way,” will only work if two or more victims actually pay the ransom of 2 bitcoin. Thus, if victims choose to restore their files by infecting more devices or people, it will lead to increased revenues for the hacking group.</p>
    <p>In the original screenshot of the Popcorn Time ransomware countdown, the creators behind the ransomware identified themselves as computer science students in Syria trying to fight against the wars that continue to occur within the region.</p>
    <p>In addition, the Syrian hackers also emphasized that the encryption algorithm is on par with government algorithms in terms of cryptography and security. The group also <a href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/806595092177965058">stated</a>, “We store your personal decryption code to your files on our servers and we are the only ones that can decrypt your files. Please don’t try to be smart, anything other than payment will cause damage to your files and the files will be lost forever.”</p>
    <p>Ultimately, victims of the Popcorn Time ransomware have 7 days or 168 hours to make a decision. It is highly likely that the hackers set a due date of the payment as the hackers hope to push the victims in spreading the malware.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17044 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-86.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-86.png 622w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-86-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"/></p>
    <p>After the payment is sent and files are decrypted, the hackers explain their intentions behind this attack. The group also <a href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/806597164642291713">noted</a>, “We know that we forced you to pay, but be sure that the payment was for a good cause. The money you gave will be used for medicine, food and shelter to those in need.”</p>
