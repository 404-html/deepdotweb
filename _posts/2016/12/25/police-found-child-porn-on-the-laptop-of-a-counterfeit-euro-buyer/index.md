    <p>In 2015, the German Federal Police (BKA) located a suspected buyer of counterfeit Euros in Hamm. <a href="http://www.wa.de/hamm/gegen-20-jaehrigen-hamm-falschgeld-gefunden-wurde-wird-wegen-sexuellen-missbrauch-ermittelt-7105561.html">Officers raided the suspect&#8217;s residence</a> in East Hamm of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. During the November raid, police found no trace of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=euro">counterfeit euros</a> but instead found 200 counterfeit US dollars. The BKA found no evidence that warranted incarceration; the suspect remained a free man. Officers did, however, seize two encrypted laptops.</p>

    <p>The investigation began after police busted a ring of counterfeiters in Italyâ€”in 2014. This Italian counterfeiting ring only sold to 90 customers, according to the BKA. Europol, in conjunction with the BKA, identified many of the buyers, including the 20-year-old from Hamm. Investigators believed the suspect, who lived at home with his family, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/12/07/counterfeit-euros-new-trend-among-dark-net-criminals/">bought counterfeit euros for 10 &#8211; 20 percent of face value</a> online. They believed they had evidence that he used Bitcoin on the darknet to purchase the &#8220;Made in Italy&#8221; branded euro.</p>
    <p>He refused to speak to the police about his case. &#8220;He has made no statements at all and can be represented by a lawyer,&#8221; an officer said. &#8220;The origin of this counterfeit money is still unclear,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Where did the $ 100 bills come from? What did he do with them? Did he already spend fake US bills? They soon found that the US dollars, all 200 copies of the $100 bill, held next to no value. &#8220;They were stupid imitations that anyone could have printed out on the Internet,&#8221; according to the prosecutor. The original maker of the bills, whoever, it was, printed them all with the same serial number.</p>
    <p>Two months following the raid, forensic analysts cracked both laptops. Instead of finding evidence relating to counterfeit euros or counterfeit US dollars, they found child pornography. BKA officials, along with Europol, firmly believed the 20-year-old ordered fake euros but with the lack of evidence, the case stuttered to a halt. And, additionally, the prosecutor&#8217;s office in Dortmund officially closed the case. For obvious reasons, child pornography concerned law enforcement to a greater degree than the counterfeits did.</p>
    <p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.wa.de/hamm/blueten-herkunft-unklar-hammer-19-huellt-sich-schweigen-5876613.html">The 20-year-old now has a problem</a>. On his computer, the investigators discovered child pornography, the prosecutor&#8217;s office in Dortmund announced. &#8220;Whether the photos and films were made by himself or downloaded from the Internet is now under review. An appropriate investigation against the 20-year-old has been initiated.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The BKA, along with Europol, closed the currency-related cases against the 20-year-old. Officials gave no word regarding the results of the other raids tied to the Italian group. The BKA and Europol raided suspected-fake-euro-buyers in nine federal states but never announced the outcome.</p>
