    <p>Three men were <a href="http://www.krone.at/oesterreich/darknet-dealer-in-oberoesterreich-verhaftet-trio-ausgeforscht-story-540593">arrested</a> in Vöcklabruck, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/austria/">Austria</a> who are suspected of running a vendor shop on the dark web.</p>
    <p>A 47-year-old and two 20-year-old men allegedly sold about one kilogram of <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/amphetamine/">amphetamines</a> on the dark net. Police information says the trio was in business from September 2015 to November 2016. The vendor group dealt in bulk orders of amphetamines, they allegedly sent out 10 to 11 orders to their customers with each package containing at least 100 grams of speed. According to law enforcement authorities, the customers of the vendor trio were also drug dealers who bought the narcotics for trafficking purposes. Police also added that the trio had financed their own drug dependencies from the profits they made.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement authorities discovered the trio’s illegal activities when they intercepted a parcel containing 109 grams of amphetamines addressed to a customer in Vienna. The customs found the drugs during a routine inspection. The three suspects are currently held in detention in an underground prison in Wels.</p>
    <p>Earlier this month, “<a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/26/austrian-police-bust-19-year-old-powerseller-darknet-vender/">Hedon</a>”, an Austrian narcotics vendor was busted by authorities. The 19-year-old was arrested after a 20 months long investigation by the National Police Directorate (LPD). The dealer was active on dark net markets since April 18, 2015, and made over 1,800 sales. After the LPD noticed the illegal activities of the vendor, the agency alerted the National Criminal Police (LKA) in Vienna who started to investigate the case. At first, they only knew minimal information about the suspect who was either working at a pharmacy or was studying as a pharmacist.</p>
    <p>Hedon sold mostly products that were only acquired from pharmacy stores. The narcotics contained prescription <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/drugs/">drugs</a>, such as Modafinil, Robaxin (Methocarbamol), Codeine, antidepressants, and nootropics including Piracetam, Phenylpiracetam, Etifoxine and Tehoten. The latter narcotic could be hardly considered as a nootropic since the lack of conclusive cognitive enhancements. The vendor also sold <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/lsd/">LSD</a>, magic mushrooms, and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/cannabis/">cannabis</a> seeds to his customers.</p>
    <p><a id="post-16746-_gjdgxs"></a> After more than 20 months of investigation, police managed to match the profile of the suspect. The law enforcement hunt ended on November 8 when authorities raided the 19-year-old’s apartment in Wien-Meidling. According to LKA officer Roman Hahslinger, the raid was a success. Police found all drugs listed on the dark net markets Hedon vended on. They seized two travel bags full of narcotics and two cartons full of various substances. In addition to that, authorities also found the usual “dealer stuff”: scales, scoops, and mailing supplies.</p>
    <p>“Since April he had 1,800 transactions posted on his account,” said Hahslinger.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old is currently held in custody until his first court date takes place. According to police information, the suspect denied all accusations against him. He did not contribute to the investigation in any way. Hahslinger added that “[the suspect] has not any given any information on the facts, so far.”</p>
    <p>The alleged dark net vendor’s court date is expected to be set sometime towards the end of November.</p>
