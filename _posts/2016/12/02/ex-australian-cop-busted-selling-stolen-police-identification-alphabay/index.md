    <p>Former Australian police officer James Goris was arrested Tuesday morning in correlation with a raid on his home in Castlemaine following a five-month investigation. <a href="http://www.edenmagnet.com.au/story/4313207/former-cop-sold-fake-police-ids-online-court-told/?cs=4090">An investigation</a> into Goris’ online habits started when he was accused of selling fake police, airport, and port authority identification on the Darknet.</p>
    <p>Police stated that they had fears the documents could be used by anyone in order to gain access to a police station, as well as to bypass airport security. The court was told that Goris’ crimes could have aided terrorists and a number of other criminals. Goris’ investigation was a joint effort by Victoria Police’s E-Crime Squad, Australian Federal Police, and NSW Police.</p>
    <p><a id="post-16711-_gjdgxs"></a> Goris served with the Victoria Police until 2010 and denied bail by Bendigo Magistrates’ Court Wednesday. Goris is currently facing five separate charges. Goris set up shop on the popular Darknet marketplace, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay/">Alphabay</a>.</p>
    <p>Detective Senior Constable Cameron Pye stated that Goris fell into their radar during a routine policing of the marketplace. On July 6th, Goris was set up by law enforcement; who bought both Victoria Police Identification cards, as well as Australian Federal Police I.D.s, official badge wallets and the badges to go with them. Bitcoin in the amount of $4,800 was paid to Goris.</p>
    <p>Another undercover transaction was conducted, involving the purchase of certain Aviation and maritime security cards, that would allow the holder access to any one of Australia’s airports and ports. Detectives also purchased an Australian Federal Police badge, wallet, and other identification documents from Goris. Each purchase was shipped by using Australia’s Post Express.</p>
    <p>During each of the sales, Goris was recorded bragging about how with these documents, he could obtain firearms and drugs from police stations without anyone batting an eye. Constable Pye stated that there were no drugs or guns found during the raid, and also stated that Goris was just trying to lure more business in so he could make more money. Courts also decided that Goris’ actions were purely motivated by his own financial gain.</p>
    <p>Police confiscated several police badges from various states and territories, as well as from the Australian Federal Police. Badge wallets, blank identification cards, special card printers, police issued clothing and multiple forms of digital evidence were all collected.</p>
    <p>In an attempt to lighten his load, Goris told officers that after every transaction was complete, he would call into Crime Stoppers and leave the recipient’s name and address information to tip off authorities to the receivers whereabouts. Upon investigation, police found two reports on Crime Stoppers on their own transactions with Goris. Law enforcement believes that Goris made two other transactions that were not with undercover officers.</p>
    <p>Even though the cards Goris was selling were a dead ringer for the real things, Pye said that they lacked the encryption needed for someone to access police stations, but the user could easily follow behind any one of the actual officers on duty, and essentially “piggy back” their way to access drugs and guns:</p>
    <p><strong><em>For the purpose for which they were made, they would absolutely be able to pass their way into a police station. I am absolutely saying they could follow another member in and get a gun. The crime is only limited by their imagination</em></strong>.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16712 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/word-image-14.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/word-image-14.jpeg 620w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/word-image-14-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
    <p>Defense counsel Peter Baker agreed with the courts that Goris’ only motivation was for pure financial gain, and also pointed out that this meant there were no other criminal motives besides making money.</p>
    <p>Goris was denied bail, due to the courts feeling he could easily forge more documents that would enable him to leave the country. They cited his expert document fraud skills as their top reason for denying his bail, which Baker said was purely speculative.</p>
    <p>Police told the courts that the potential for these documents to fall into the hands of more malevolent minded criminals could have been disastrous:</p>
    <p><strong><em>I don’t think I’m overreacting when I say, ‘What if these police badges got into the wrong hands?’ Could we have armed robberies&#8230;a terrorist? It’s a very real threat. It was very well thought out. As a former member of the police force, he would know the consequences</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>Goris is still in custody, and is scheduled for court in Bendigo Magistrates’ Court again on February 15<sup>th</sup>, 2017.</p>
