    <p>In Manisa, Turkey, an official spoke to the press regarding an ongoing drug dependency issue—precisely an issue tied to the darknet. Dr. Ümit Atman, Head of the Public Health Department’s Drug Dependency Program, had a unique perspective. She said that 30 percent of the people hospitalized for drug issues purchased the substance(s) online. The increasing number of hospitalizations, she said, indicate the desperate need to combat the darknet drug problem.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17000 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-21.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-21.jpeg 645w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-21-300x160.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px"/> Atman said, &#8220;We see that there is a number of drug users in this country that we have never seen before.&#8221; She referenced important figures from the latest <a href="https://www.unodc.org/doc/wdr2016/WORLD_DRUG_REPORT_2016_web.pdf">World Drug Report</a> from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The report, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/24/global-drug-survey-2017-will-highlight-darknet-drug-users-worldwide/">like many studies conducted in 2016</a>, paid particular attention to online drug markets. Many who participated in the study spoke highly of the darknet; they found higher quality drugs and an overall lack of risk. However, she said that the darknet only helped the current epidemic in Turkey.</p>
    <p>Turkey, for several years now, has been struggling in a <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/drugs-worth-25-million-turkish-liras-seized-in-istanbul-.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=104788&amp;NewsCatID=509">fight against synthetic cannabinoids</a>. In 2012, Turkey’s own Annual [Drug] Report—released by the Directorate of Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crime Department—highlighted “Bonzai.” At the time, Bonzai was a colloquial term for 11 types of cannabinoids: nine JWH variants and two other, lesser known homologs of THC. The report noted that internet sales of Bonzai—sold as Spice—began increasing in 2006. As police tightened their grip on the drug(s), many users turned to the darknet. Dr. Atman said children, even 14-years-olds, started doing the same.</p>
    <p>Joris Leverink, a freelance journalist in Istanbul, compared <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Bonzai-Epidemic-Hits-Turkey-New-Drug-Old-Story-20150121-0036.html">Turkey’s Bonzai problem to the crack cocaine issues in America</a>. “The history of bonzai in Turkey is eerily reminiscent of the rise and spread of crack cocaine in the United States from the mid-1980s onwards.” He continued, “and the Turkish government&#8217;s reaction to the issue uncomfortably resonates the narratives and policies of the US&#8217; so-called &#8220;War on Drugs.&#8221;</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17001 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-22.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-22.jpeg 1000w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-22-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"/> Dr. Atman said that hospitals offer free rehabilitation services, but only one out of every six addicts receives treatment. Even then, the treatment rarely succeeds. She placed a greater importance on spreading awareness of the dangers associated with synthetic cannabinoid use. At the clinic, patients started, on average, using these drugs at age 13. However, applications for the hospital often reveal that many patients faced exposure to the drug at nine-years-old.</p>
    <p>She brought up something that recently became a trend after she spoke with several 13-year-olds and 14-year-olds. One of the children told her explained the mailing process: “<a href="http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1333046-manisada-mont-siparisi-kilifiyla-uyusturucu-ticareti">We order my coat. When we order the pants, we get drugs in the jacket pocket</a>.” He continued, “however; we get a ‘technically certified’ coat and the drug delivered to us.”</p>
    <p>The practice above, she has since discovered, is widely used among Turkey’s youth. The greatest threat to the future, she said, is that 30 percent of the Bonzai came from the internet. It shows no sign of stopping either. She concluded, saying the right move is to treat the darknet drug trade the same as the “fight against terrorist activities, smuggling, counterfeiting.”</p>
