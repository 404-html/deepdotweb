    <p>According to information from the Zadar Municipal Court, an 18-year-old Croatian high school student was <a href="http://www.vijesti.rtl.hr/novosti/hrvatska/2024367/internetski-prevarant-iz-zadra-nasamario-trideset-ljudi-djevojci-umjesto-iphonea-5-isporucio-cjepanicu/">arrested</a> for internet fraud.</p>
    <p>Court information says the suspect scammed nearly 30 persons who tried to buy products from the 18-year-old. For example, the fraudster advertised an iPhone 5, which a customer bought and when she opened the package it contained worthless pieces of wood. The 18-year-old sent everyone junk items instead of the genuine ones he advertised. Authorities say the suspect made about 200,000 HRK (about $28,600) by scamming people. Since the lack of information provided, it is unclear which website did the suspect used to sell his “products” and whether the dark web was involved in his business.</p>
    <p>After the 18-year-old was detained by Croatian law enforcement authorities, he was released on bail, however, the high school student escaped to Austria to avoid prosecution. Although, he changed his mind shortly after and returned back to Zadar admitting the charges against him.</p>
    <p>Prosecution asked for a sentence of two years and eight months in prison for the suspect, however, the judge gave the student a more lenient sentence. Since the money the 18-year-old earned by fraud was not spent, he was sentenced to pay back to victims. The high school student can consider himself lucky in this case.</p>
    <p>There are plenty of internet <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/fraud/">fraud</a> cases all over the world. An example is Dwayne C. Hans, a US citizen who is <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/07/fraudsters-case-opened-back-awaits-courts-decision/">accused</a> of stealing $134,000 from a financial institution and for an attempted theft of $1.5 million more. According to official court documents, the suspect headed a series of fraud attacks against financial institutions in the country pretending he was an authorized representative of the institutions. When he successfully pulled off the scam, he was able to transfer money from institution corporate accounts to his personal ones. The fraudster is also charged with unauthorized access to a website that was run by the U.S. General Services Administration, stealing funds and wiring them to his own bank accounts. A press release on the Department of Justice (DOJ) website covers up the case in more details:</p>
    <p>“Posing as someone authorized to conduct financial transactions for the financial institution, the defendant misappropriated money from corporate bank accounts to buy shares of stock in publicly traded companies, invest in a real estate property in Brooklyn, and benefit his family members. He also conducted an unauthorized intrusion into the website SAM.gov, which stores information about companies that provide services to the federal government. During this unauthorized website intrusion, the defendant changed information in entries pertaining to the financial institution, including by replacing the bank account information. As a result, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation sent more than $1.5 million to the defendant instead of the financial institution.”</p>
    <p>Hans was arrested on October 26 in Richland, Washington after a criminal complaint was issued by the Eastern District of New York. All charges against the suspect remained allegations.</p>
