    <p>Throughout 2016, researchers began explicitly focusing on darknet-market-related information. In June, The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) found that <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/06/16/eu-drug-report-2016-every-4th-european-has-tried-illicit-drugs-importance-of-the-dark-web/">every fourth European used illegal substances</a>. Moreover, the Global Drug Survey 2016 observed that <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/24/global-drug-survey-2017-will-highlight-darknet-drug-users-worldwide/">9.3 percent of participants reported using the darknet to buy drugs</a>. The Trimbos Institute, Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, recently published a similar study: Purity, adulteration, and price of drugs purchased online versus offline the Netherlands. Somehow, contrary to common belief, online drugs were proven to be no better than offline ones, in the Netherlands.</p>
    <p>As the title suggests, the study focused mainly on the purity of drugs purchased online&#8211;both clearnet and darknet&#8211;versus those from the street. The organization &#8220;conducts research on issues related to mental health and addiction,&#8221; the About Us page explains. &#8220;The experts at the Trimbos Institute put research findings into practice to support policymakers, educators, and professionals who provide mental health and addiction services.&#8221; Compared to the Global Drug Survey (GDS), EMCDDA, and RAND, this organization might be one of the least recognizable to the majority of the world. However, they have a partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and publish several studies every year.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, the GDS 2016 noted that respondents used the darknet significantly more often than in the past. “<a href="https://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GDS2016-Press-Release-1.pdf">The darknet rising</a>” highlighted the darknet section.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Globally almost in 1 in 10 participants (9.3%) reported ever buying drugs off the darknet with that reporting last year dark-net purchase increasing from 4.5% to 6.7%.</li>
    <li>MDMA, cannabis, new or novel substances (including 2C-B and DMT) and LSD are the drugs most commonly bought</li>
    <li>5% of respondents stated that they did not consume drugs before accessing them through darknet markets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Similarly, The Trimbos Institute reported that consumers purchased from online sources more frequently, nearly matching global figures. Consumer online purchases increased from 1.4% in 2013 to 4.1% in 2015. However, in the Netherlands at least, no significant differences between the online drugs and street drugs existed. They studied 32,663 samples provided by consumers between 2013 &#8211; 2016. Of those consumer-provided samples, only 928 samples reportedly came from online sources. The study focused primarily on stimulants and &#8220;hallucinogens.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The paper specifically mentioned: MDA, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=mdma">MDMA</a>, MDEA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, mCPP, phenacetin, cocaine, 2C-B, levamisole, GHB, GBL, LSD, 4-FA, 4-MA, lidocaine, procaine, noscapine, 5/6-APB), methoxetamine, and &#8220;other pharmacologically active compounds, such as medicines or illicit drugs from the NIST library.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The MDMA on the streets in the Netherlands, contrary to popular belief, was found to be of a higher purity than the MDMA from the internet. 45% on the street vs. 61% online. Ecstasy tablets from the web showed the opposite results: 131mg vs. 121mg. Of the three major entactogenic compounds studied, 4-FA showed a higher purity (online 59% versus offline 52%) and, of adulterated samples, 4-FA showed the smallest percent of impurities.</p>
    <p>A universal standard that the researchers found was that of pricing; the online variants were 10% to 23% more expensive than their offline counterparts.</p>
