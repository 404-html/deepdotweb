    <p>Bitcoin is a bit like the wild west of finance. If you want to be the one walking away towards the setting sun when the dust settles, you have to be extra careful as Bitcoin scams and ponzi schemes are everywhere. Unfortunately, these scams often work and many “investors” are left at the bottom of the pyramid holding an empty wallet where their bitcoins used to be. We want to make sure that this does not happen to you, and as so we are going to show you some examples on how to get interest on your Bitcoin without falling victim to these elaborate schemes that seek to rob you of your beloved coins.</p>
    <p>Before we start, a few guidelines would be to stay away from any model that offers ridiculous interest rates like 1% per day or 10% per month. The same can be said for any model that is not transparent on how they get this interest or that simply state that profits comes from trading. Finally, do your research. A simple google search can make the difference. <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1326821.0">There is also a very good thread on Bitcointalk listing some known scams</a>.</p>
    <p>This is a four part guide on how to earn interest on your Bitcoin from reliable sources. The first part was on how to lend cryptocurrencies using Magnr. Last time we introduced our users to P2P lending, more specifically on Bibond. This time, we’re going to talk about another P2P lending website, BTCJam.</p>
    <p>Be aware that these websites are third party services and that you will be entrusting your funds to them. Although these are very reputable sources, there is always the possibility that your funds will be lost in the event of an hack, inside theft, etc.. So if you want to take no chances, just keep your Bitcoin in a private wallet, and keep your private keys safe.</p>
    <p>If you do decide to invest, however, it may be a good idea to spread your coins around the various places we discuss. Like they say “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”.</p>
    <p><strong>BTCJam P2P Lending</strong></p>
    <p>BTCJam is another P2P lending website that allows lenders and borrowers to bypass banks and have access to savings and loans on a peer-to-peer system. BTCjam was founded in late 2012 and by the end of 2014, BTCjam had facilitated bitcoin loans in excess of $10 million dollars in value with more than 100,000 users in over 200 countries. BTCjam also has an “Autoinvest” feature, which allows you to keep a diversified portfolio without having to monitor the loan offers. This feature will take your designated parameters into account and find suitable investment opportunities.</p>
    <p>Today, we’re going to teach how to invest in loans using the BTCjam website. With this fourth part, our tutorial comes to an end. Hopefully, it will have helped you steer away from scams and focus on worthwhile opportunities only.</p>

    <p><img class="wp-image-17056 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-91.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-91.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-91-300x112.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>You can signup with facebook or create a new account. We’re going to create a new account. Enter your personal details, agree with the terms&amp;conditions and click “<strong>Sign Up”</strong></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17057 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-92.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-92.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-92-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>BTCjam will send you a confirmation email. Click the link inside to confirm your account</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17058 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-93.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-93.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-93-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p>You’ll be logged into your account and your email will be verified</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17059 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-94.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-94.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-94-300x49.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Funding your account</strong></p>
    <p>Now that you’re logged in, it’s time to fund your account with bitcoin.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Click “<strong>Add funds</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17060 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-95.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-95.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-95-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>You’ll be shown a BTC address. Send the bitcoin you want to invest to it. Remember, this ddress is valid for 24 hours, so make sure to check if it’ still valid before sending any funds</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17061 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-96.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-96.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-96-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Wait for the transaction to be confirmed (it should take around 30 minutes) and then click “<strong>Invest</strong>”</p>
    <p><strong>Investing</strong></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17062 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-97.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-97.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-97-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>You’ll be taken to a list of current investment opportunities. Much like the previous website we analysed, Bitbond, you can filter the loans. Choose the time you want your investment to last</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17063 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-98.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-98.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-98-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Choose your risk factor. BTCjam ranks investment opportunities from A to D, A being the less risky and vice-versa</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17064 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-99.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-99.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-99-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>You can also choose which currency you want to invest in. Despite being a bitcoin-based website, BTCjam allows you to peg your investment to multiple national currencies. This means that despite the price movements of bitcoin, you’ll receive the fiat value of your investment + interest (according to the Coindesk index price).</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17065 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-100.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-100.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-100-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Once you see an investment opportunity that pleases you, click on it to see more details</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17066 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-101.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-101.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-101-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Now that you’re on the loan’s page, there are multiple factors to check. The most important of which is to check how complete and verified the borrower’s profile is. The more fields verified, the safer the investment is, but the most important factors would be a verified identity and income</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17067 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-102.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-102.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-102-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>It is equally important to check the loan’s description. Does the borrower specify how he plans to recover the loan? Is his business model good? If he has a solid and profitable business or idea lined up, then there is a higher chance of him repaying the loan. In this case, the borrower will invest in cryptocurrency mining, which is usually profitable depending on the country</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17068 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-103.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-103.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-103-300x44.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Don’t forget to check how well-funded the loan already is and the investors that have already participated. Do they have a history of positive income? If so, then they probably know what they’re doing.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17069 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-104.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-104.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-104-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>If you decide that you want to invest, then scroll back up and click “<strong>Invest</strong>”. Don’t forget to check the APY, which can be found above the “Invest” button. In this case, it’s 8.26%</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17070 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-105.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-105.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-105-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Enter the amount of Bitcoin you want to invest (We’ll invest 0.02) and click “<strong>Invest</strong>” <img class="wp-image-17071 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-106.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-106.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-106-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p>That’s it! You have just invested in a loan</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17072 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-107.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-107.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-107-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p>It doesn’t end here, however! If you like BTCjam and you want to continue to invest regularly, you can also check out the “Autoinvest” feature, which allows you to keep a diversified portfolio without having to monitor the loan offers. This feature will take your designated parameters into account and find suitable investment opportunities.</p>
    <p><strong>AutoInvest</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>To start the auto investment plan, click “<strong>Autoinvest” </strong></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17073 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-108.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-108.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-108-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Then click <strong>“Create a Plan”</strong></p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17074 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-109.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-109.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-109-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Lastly, choose a type of plan and how much BTC/USD you want to invest, then click “<strong>Activate Plan</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-17075 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-110.png" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-110.png 869w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/word-image-110-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
    <p>This will activate an auto investment plan that can be turned off at any time. This concludes the “How to earn Interest on your Bitcoin” tutorial series. Hopefully, it will have helped you steer away from scams and focus on worthwhile opportunities only.</p>
