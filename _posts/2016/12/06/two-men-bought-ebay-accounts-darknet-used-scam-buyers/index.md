    <p>On November 29, a judge in Windeck sentenced two men for fraud—both on the clearnet and on the darknet. They bought email and eBay logins from the darknet and used the accounts to scam buyers. The two would list items on the stolen eBay account, get paid, and never ship the product.</p>
    <p>The accounts were never in either man&#8217;s name; the true account owner ended up paying for the duo&#8217;s fraud. The prosecutor revealed that the items were not petty either. Often times, the men would sell large-scale, expensive items. Judge Dr. Fabian Krapoth, the judge that oversaw the case, mentioned camera sales. Investigators said $19,160 worth came from the camera sales. Later on, police discovered another $106,445 of damage.</p>
    <p>Both men, a 21-year-old and a 22-year-old, worked with an accomplice, officials said. Investigators were unaware of the third party&#8217;s identity. But, one of the primary suspects—during the sentencing—announced the partner&#8217;s name. Police are now investigating the third member, authorities announced. For this reason, LKA officials refused to disclose further information.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.ksta.de/region/rhein-sieg-bonn/eitorf---windeck/hoher-sachschaden-internet-betrug-im-grossen-stil---duo-aus-windeck-verurteilt-25192450">prosecution took a long time reading the charges</a>, a local paper reported. The prosecution read, out loud to the Waldbröler District Court, more than 85 charges. At the time of the crime, the younger man was only 19-years-old. At 19, he was still under the juvenile law. Judge Dr. Fabian Krapoth convicted the 21-year-old on all 85 counts of &#8220;serious&#8221; fraud. But because he was a minor at the time of the crime, he received only one year and six month probation. The court ordered him to spend 25 hours, monthly, working for charitable causes.</p>
    <p>His companion, the 22-year-old, received convictions in all three charges presented. The court gave him a fine of 60 daily rates of 25 euros each. The 22-year-old played a much less significant role in the fraud than his younger accomplice. The younger man paid the 22-year-old $400 to open three bank accounts. Investigators believed that to be the entirety of the 22-year-old&#8217;s role.</p>
    <p>Reporters said that both defendants confessed their own crimes. The admission of guilt, though, had a detrimental effect on the sentence. Their admissions also released the name of the third partner. Courtroom reporters reported that this part of the admission was purely accidental. We recently wrote about the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/04/defendant-sentenced-probation-using-fake-euros-darknet/">Emmendingen District Court sentencing a 25-year-old</a> to two years on probation. He bought fake euros off the darknet and used them locally, racking up thousands in damage. He worked with police and cooperated fully. In his case, the cooperation helped.</p>
    <p>Courtroom reporters also pointed out that employment status impacted the sentencing. The younger man was unemployed and used this fraud as his primary source of income. The older one was an “industry” worker and only gained $400 from the ordeal..</p>
    <p>&#8220;Overall, the fraud activities on the Internet resulted in a loss of around $106,000, said Krapoth, director of the District Court. &#8220;The two young people were not necessarily clever in their fraud, but were partly quite clumsy&#8221;</p>
