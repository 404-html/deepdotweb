    <p>Jonathan Bettez, a 36-year-old Canadian man was arrested for possessing child pornography. According to police information, the man had access to <a href="http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2016/12/09/bettez-aurait-visionne-des-agressions-sexuelles-denfants-sur-internet">967 child porn files</a> containing images and videos from children aged 3 months to 12 years who were being assaulted sexually.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement authorities searched for the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=child+porn">child porn</a> data and in a police database and compared the files found on the man’s computer, however, they did not find anything illegal on the device at first. On April 29, a judge allowed authorities to secretly make mirror copies of Bettez’s computer, although, the action was unsuccessful. On July 18, the Canadians made another attempt, they knocked on the 36-year-old’s door and searched his home, they found two tower PCs, however, the hard disks were all empty.</p>
    <p>On August 29, police made a more thorough investigation on the Canadian man’s devices. At the suspect’s home, they found two USB drives and an external hard drive. Forensic experts are currently reconstructing the data from these devices. Law enforcement authorities also seized a personal computer a Blackberry cell phone a 4GB SD card and a SIM card. In the room of Bettez’s parents, police found a laptop, where investigators found traces to more than 100 child pornography files.</p>
    <p>Police also found that Bettez was active on dark web child porn forums. He used usernames on the websites, such as &#8220;LureThem; Small-Tits; LuvDaddy; Traders and IWANTPIX&#8221;. The investigation also showed that the man participated in several discussions on these websites and invited other users to exchange child pornography material. The file names the 36-year-old searched for included &#8220;Young lolita, Childporn Private Daughter; Babyshivid childlover&#8221;, however, police did not found the computer Bettez used to access the data.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old attracted more police heat from <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/canada/">Canadian</a> law enforcement authorities. Bettez’s case is really rare: authorities don’t use this much resources in a single investigation. Between June 15 and December 15, 2015 Canadian officials conducted numerous “spinnings” and monitored the whereabouts of the man. According to police information, investigators noted the time when the suspect entered and left his office, the bars and the poker clubs he visited. Law enforcement authorities also asked permission from court twice to intercept audio and video communications of Jonathan Bettez. For three months, he did not know that he was monitored by police in his own office. In addition to that, investigators placed a geolocator device in the suspect’s car to track all his movements for six months.</p>
    <p><a id="post-17121-_gjdgxs"></a> Law enforcement authorities also wanted to know how many electronic devices the 36-year-old had access to. Through a court order, police obtained from Facebook the 61 IP addresses Bettez used to login to the popular social media platform. By a careful analysis of these IP addresses, particularly those associated with the suspect’s accounts on child <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/pornography/">pornography</a> forums, investigators were able to determine that the man had access to 967 child porn files between 2010 and 2015.</p>
