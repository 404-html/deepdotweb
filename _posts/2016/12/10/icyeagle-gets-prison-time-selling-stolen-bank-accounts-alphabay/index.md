    <p>An Atlanta <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/icyeagle-dark-web-vendor-stolen-information-sentenced-federal-prison">judge just sentenced Aaron James Glende aka IcyEagle</a> to four years and two months in prison. IcyEagle sold stolen login credentials on the darknet, specifically on the AlphaBay marketplace. At his peak, <a href="https://blog.surfwatchlabs.com/2016/08/15/icyeagle-a-look-at-the-arrest-of-an-alleged-dark-web-vendor/">he posted 300 different listings</a>, including SunTrust bank accounts with a $500,000 account balance. The 35-year-old hacker ordered Oxycodone in early 2016 that a Postal Inspector intercepted by chance. From there, the FBI fully investigated Glende.</p>
    <p>Police arrested Glende after the Oxycodone shipment but released him shortly thereafter. They were unsure if he was buying for personal use or buying to redistribute. Police received a warrant for Glende’s home and discovered evidence of distribution. Officers reportedly found two USPS packages ready to be mailed. They contained Valium, Xanax, and oxycodone. Officers also reportedly found 600 Xanax pills, dextroamphetamine capsules, 138 oxycodone pills, 50 Valiums, marijuana, and marijuana wax. Glende received six felony charges.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16855 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-6.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-6.jpeg 900w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-6-300x120.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> His home was one block away from a park. Because of the proximity to the park, he also <a href="http://www.winonapost.com/Article/ArticleID/48291/Postal-Service-tip-leads-to-drug-arrest">received second-degree sale of oxycodone in a park zone</a>, punishable by up to 25 years in prison.</p>
    <p>Officers released Glende, and the FBI continued their case against him. While the suspect was in custody, the FBI connected Glende to his darknet username. He sold SunTrust accounts almost exclusively but occasionally <a href="http://www.11alive.com/news/local/fbi-hacker-stole-passwords-sold-them-to-the-highest-bidder/283527778">sold Bank of America and Amazon accounts</a>.</p>
    <p>“Glende sold stolen bank account information and other login credentials on AlphaBay, a ‘Dark Web’ website devoted to the anonymous sale of criminal goods and services, including weapons, stolen credit cards, and illegal narcotics,” said U.S. Attorney John Horn.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16856 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-29.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-29.png 658w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-29-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /> Undercover agents purchased stolen credentials from Glende’s <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tag/alphabay/">AlphaBay</a> account on two separate occasions. Agents purchased stolen credentials with bitcoin in both March and April 2016. One agent’s purchase proved to be the most valuable, per the DoJ:</p>
    <p>While on the website, the agent purchased SunTrust account information from Glende using Bitcoin. A review of the information purchased from Glende confirmed that it contained usernames, passwords, physical addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and bank account numbers that belonged to five different SunTrust Bank customers.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333047309/Icy-Eagle">IcyEagle listed SunTrust Credentials</a> with the title “High Balance SunTrust Logins 30K-150K Available.” He wrote in the description of one listing that “I bring you freshly hacked Sun Trust Bank Account Logins. The accounts are notorious for having weak security.” Authorities said that IcyEagle ran a sale of “Hacked SunTrust Bank Account Logins $100-$500 Balances.” These accounts only cost $9.99, federal agents pointed out in the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333047309/Icy-Eagle">indictment</a>.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16857 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-7.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-7.jpeg 900w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-7-300x176.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><br />
    After the successful buys, the FBI advanced on Glende. In July, agents received yet another warrant to search home. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/icyeagle-dark-web-vendor-stolen-information-charged-atlanta">They seized the suspect’s computer</a> and found 944 usernames and passwords for bank accounts; 1,243 usernames, passwords, and email addresses for other electronic accounts; 123 Social Security numbers; 386 credit card numbers, and 123 bank account numbers. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/26/alphabay-fraud-vendor-icyeagle-arrested/">Officers arrested Glende in mid-July</a>.</p>
    <p>On November 30, 2016, an Atlanta judge sentenced Glende to four years in a federal prison. The judge ordered three years of supervision after his release from incarceration. He pleaded guilty to access device fraud and aggravated identity theft in late September. There was no mention of the drug charges at the sentencing. The second-degree sale of drugs in a park zone can lead to 25 years in prison.</p>
