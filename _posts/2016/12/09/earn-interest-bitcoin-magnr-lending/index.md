    <p>Bitcoin is a bit like the wild west of finance. If you want to be the one walking away towards the setting sun when the dust settles, you have to be extra careful as Bitcoin scams and ponzi schemes are everywhere. Unfortunately, these scams often work and many “investors” are left at the bottom of the pyramid holding an empty wallet where their bitcoins used to be. We want to make sure that this does not happen to you, and as so we are going to show you some examples on how to get interest on your Bitcoin without falling victim to these elaborate schemes that seek to rob you of your beloved coins.</p>
    <p>Before we start, a few guidelines would be to stay away from any model that offers ridiculous interest rates like 1% per day or 10% per month. The same can be said for any model that is not transparent on how they get this interest or that simply state that profits comes from trading. Finally, do your research. A simple google search can make the difference. <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1326821.0">There is also a very good thread on Bitcointalk listing some known scams</a>.</p>
    <p>This is a four part guide on how to earn interest on your Bitcoin from reliable sources. The first part was on how to lend cryptocurrencies using the Poloniex leding feature and automating it with the Poloniex lending bot (without fees). In this second part we are going to talk about Magnr lending. The third and fourth part will refer to P2P lending.</p>
    <p>Be aware that these websites are third party services and that you will be entrusting your funds to them. Although these are very reputable sources, there is always the possibility that your funds will be lost in the event of an hack, inside theft, etc.. So if you want to take no chances, just keep your Bitcoin in a private wallet, and keep your private keys safe.</p>
    <p>If you do decide to invest, however, it may be a good idea to spread your coins around the various places we discuss. Like they say “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”.</p>
    <p><strong>Magnr Lending</strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://magnr.com">Magnr</a> is a Bitcoin trading and savings platform. Much like Poloniex, it allows users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage. This leverage comes from users that open a Magnr savings account. While giving a lower APY than Poloniex lending, Magnr is completely automated, meaning that you do not have to post constant loan offers, nor do you have to host a lending bot on your computer. Active since 2013, Magnr secures funds using BitGo’s technology, using multiple private keys and and a hierarchical address structure. All web traffic data is communicated over SSL 256-bit AES encryption channels.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Log into your account. Click Login on the right upper corner</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16834 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-19.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-19.png 869w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-19-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Enter your personal information and click “<strong>Sign in</strong>” (don’t forget to enter the captcha)</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16835 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-20.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-20.png 869w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-20-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Once inside your account, all you have to do is transfer Bitcoin to your savings account. Click “<strong>Deposit Bitcoin</strong>” on the Savings section</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16836 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-21.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-21.png 869w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-21-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"/></p>
    <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Now simply send the bitcoins you want to invest to the address shown and confirm your deposit when done.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16837 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-22.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-22.png 869w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-22-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"/></p>
    <p>After confirming your deposit, you’ll be shown your incoming transactions.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16838 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-23.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-23.png 869w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-23-300x137.png 300w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-23-272x125.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"/></p>
    <p>After the sixth confirmation, your account will start earning interest, which will be paid out periodically every month as so:</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16839 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-24.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-24.png 869w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-24-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"/></p>
    <p>That’s pretty much it! Once you want to withdraw your profits all you have to do is click withdraw on the Savings account.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16840 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-25.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-25.png 869w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-25-300x35.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"/></p>
    <p>Then, just enter the amount you want to withdraw <strong>(1) </strong>and the address <strong>(2)</strong> you want to withdraw it to, then hit “<strong>Send</strong>”</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16841 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-26.png" srcset="/imgs/2016/12/word-image-26.png 869w, /imgs/2016/12/word-image-26-300x104.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"/></p>
    <p>That’s it! Now just sit back and watch your coins grow with Magnr</p>
    <p>If you want to take a stab at Trading, Magnr also allows you to do so.If you’re not proficient in trading, we would advise you to read extensively on the subject, and of course never invest more than what you can afford to lose.</p>
    <p>The APY for Magnr is usually between 1%-3%, which is considerabily lower than what you get while using Poloniex, but it’s also a steady and automated investement.</p>
