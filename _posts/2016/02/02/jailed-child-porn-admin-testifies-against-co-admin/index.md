    <p>Shannon Grant McCoole (33),<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-27/shannon-mccoole-testifies-alleged-danish-child-porn-expert/7115312"> the former administrator of the notorious The Love Zone child porn site</a>, provided evidence against a Danish man who allegedly helped him in the administering of the illegal website.</p>
    <p>McCoole has been <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/08/11/australian-darkweb-pedo-site-admin-sentenced-to-35-years-in-jail/">sentenced to 35 years</a> by South Australian court for child porn related charges.</p>
    <p>McCoole, who is kept in protective custody and under 24-hour surveillance in Yatala Labour Prison, stated that the 48-year-old Danish man, known only as ”TL”, abused 4 children and helped to administer McCoole’s child porn website. Janni Pedersen, a reporter from Denmark&#8217;s TV2 News, made this statement covering the case:</p>
    <p>&#8220;The prosecutor believes the Danish guy was a co-administrator of this very big paedophile network that Shannon McCoole was convicted of being a part of. This is a big case here in Denmark &#8230; it was quite a big thing having McCoole [testify] via videolink.&#8221;</p>
    <p>When McCoole was asked about TL in court, he said that the Danish was a ”well-known and respected” in child abuse circles. He also said this when asked about the co-admin’s activity:</p>
    <p>&#8220;He helped me find original child pornography material. In general, TL had seen so much material that if he had not seen something before, then it had to be new.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The prosecutor then asked if TL was an expert:</p>
    <p>&#8220;I would say so, with my knowledge of the paedophile environment,&#8221; McCoole said.</p>
    <p>Pedersen also made this statement:</p>
    <p>&#8220;Having [McCoole] saying in court that the Danish guy who is on trial is actually a co-administrator was a very good point for the prosecutor.&#8221;</p>
    <p>TL’s trial is expected to end as early as next month in Denmark.</p>
