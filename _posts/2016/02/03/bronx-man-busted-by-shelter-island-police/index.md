Conforto (41), a Bronx man, was arrested on felony drug charges by the Shelter Island Police Department in a joint action with other law enforcement authorities.</a> He is now in custody and awaits his trial by the Shelter Island Justice Court. Conforto was charged with three counts of the criminal sale of controlled substances and was held at Suffolk County Correction Facility in Riverside. The Bronx man was identified in an investigation led by Detective Sergeant Jack Thilberg as one of the main suppliers of cocaine, oxycodone and other substances sold on Shelter Island and to other East End communities.</p>
    <p>The Shelter Island Police Department was assisted by other law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Postal Inspection Service, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the Secret Service. Other police departments were co-operating Shelter Island in the case, such as the New York State Police, the Suffolk County District Attorney’s office and the Southold Police Department.</p>
    <p>The arrest of Conforto is part of an investigation that included the arrests of three Shelter Island men, Alec Walker, Andrew Eklund and Zachary Reylek in March 2015. According to the police, the group was selling prescription and non-prescription drugs around the area, which they sent to the buyers via the US postal service. The law enforcement authorities also noted that dark net marketplaces “were involved” in the drug business, the drug dealer group used these websites in order to buy (or sell?) illegal substances from the dark web.</p>
    <p>In the case against the three men (Walker, Eklund and Reylek), more than 25 packages containing narcotics were sent to Shelter Island through the postal service. The drugs in the mail included fentanyl, alprazolam, cocaine and oxycodone, according to the police report. The prescription drugs, which were in tablet form, were taken into evidence along with non-prescription narcotics in powder form. Electronic messaging and payments, including money orders and other fund transfers, were used to order and pay for the drugs from distributors off-Island, police said.</p>
    <p>Police added that the investigation still remains active.</p>
