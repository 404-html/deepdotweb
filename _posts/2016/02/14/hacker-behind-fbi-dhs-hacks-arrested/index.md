    <p>The pro-Palestine hacker known as “Cracka” was arrested in East Midlands, England by British authorities with the help of the FBI. The 16 year old, whose name officials have not released, is the suspected leader of “Crackas With Attitude”, the group who was responsible for the hacking of many people, including John Brennan, John Holdren, James Clapper, and Vonna Heaton.</p>
    <p>The group&#8217;s expertise appears to be “social engineering”. Just recently, they&#8217;ve made headlines by hacking the FBI and DHS, releasing thousands of names, positions, emails, and phone numbers. The FBI has been trying to take down this data but it appears to be futile considering the amount of times it&#8217;s been downloaded and <a href="https://twitter.com/CthulhuSec/status/697576949070299136">mirrored</a> already.</p>
    <p>In an email to the media, SEROCU (South East Regional Organised Crime Unit) made the statement:</p>
    <p>“The South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU) can confirm we have arrested a [16]-year-old boy on Tuesday (9/2) in the East Midlands on suspicion of conspiracy to commit Unauthorised access to computer material contrary to Section 1 Computer Misuse Act 1990, conspiracy to commit unauthorised access with intent to commit further offences contrary to Section 2 Computer Misuse Act 1990 and conspiracy to commit unauthorised acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing operation of a computer contrary to Section 3 Computer Misuse Act 1990.”</p>
    <p>Cracka is out on bail after spending 7 hours in a cell. The Daily Dot has been <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/politics/cracka-hacker-cia-john-brennan-email-arrested/">told</a> by “Cubed”, a hacker associated with CWA, that the bail is unconditional.</p>
    <p>Despite all of this, CWA promises they will not stop. In the wake Cracka&#8217;s arrest and the questioning of CWA member “DerpLaughing”, “IncursioSubter” who is associated with CWA, told <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/teenage-hackers-promise-more-hacks-after-alleged-leaders-arrest-cracka-cwa?trk_source=recommended">Motherboard</a> “Just because they managed to arrest two members doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll stop hacking them” where he then went on to say “Give us time, you&#8217;ll see. :)”</p>
    <p>Not only will CWA continue, the campaign it leads will “intensify”, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/IncursioSubter/status/698160812054159360">tweet</a> by IncursioSubter.</p>
    <p>“Will we stop attacking governments since cracka got arrested? Simple answer: no. In fact, our campaign will only intensify now.”</p>
    <p>CWA has expressed anger and a willingness to retaliate against “snitches”. Many members are speculating whether or not someone had snitched on Cracka, leading to his arrest.</p>
    <p>IncursioSubter made the statement, “If we find out who snitched Cracka out, we&#8217;ll be coming after him or her”</p>
    <p>“Zoom”, a member of CWA, added to the discussion saying the snitch was “definitely someone who knew Cracka for a few years.”</p>
    <p>Cubed had thought he would be next to be arrested after Cracka, that hasn&#8217;t happened and he now plans to “hack the planet”.</p>
