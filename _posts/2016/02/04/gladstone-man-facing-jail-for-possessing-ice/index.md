    <p><a href="http://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/news/ice-gun-accused-in-bible-studies/2915449/">Buddy Lipczynski (26) from Gladstone, has been arrested by police for possessing 1.9 grams of methylamphetamine (meth/ice).</a> The man was on suspended jail sentence since he pleaded guilty last August to possession of a document on a flash drive that held instructions on the manufacturing of methylamphetamine. Lipcynski has stood before court several times for multiple drug-related charges and for allegedly importing a firearm from the dark web. The 26-year-old man was arrested in New Auckland and is now facing charges at Gladstone court.</p>
    <p>Cassandra Ditchfield, defending Lipcynski, told court that her defendant relapsed due to “the pressure of impending court matters” and spent his time at church and reading the Bible.</p>
    <p>Gavin Reece from prosecution opposed the bail for Lipcynski fearing that the man will re-offend. He also made this statement:</p>
    <p>&#8220;He is accused of importing firearms over the web, and received a suspended jail term for having instructions on methylamphetamine production.&#8221;</p>
    <p>According to Ditchfield, Lipczynski previously complied with daily police reporting conditions and accepted he had a drug issue. She said her defendant had been getting himself sorted over his drug issues and was not socializing with other drug users.</p>
    <p>&#8220;He has addressed it to the point it is nowhere as bad as February last year. But as the pressure mounts, he has relapsed. He&#8217;s been attending church every Sunday and Bible studies in an attempt to assist him,&#8221; Ditchfield said.</p>
    <p>She also stated that Lipcynski needed bail to complete bathroom renovations so he could rent out his home. Magistrate Penelope Hay refused bail, saying she was not satisfied with the fact that the man would not commit further drug offenses given his addiction.</p>
