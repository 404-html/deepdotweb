    <p>Matthew David Graham (23), using the pseudonym ”Lux” on his site, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/09/15/child-porn-ring-admin-lux-pleads-guilty/">was the administrator of one of the biggest child porn rings</a> that had more than 215,000 users at the time. The pedo site was infamous for its brutality; Lux’s website featured hurtcore child porn. Graham in 2014 decided to close down the whole domain. <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/06/24/large-number-of-child-abuse-sites-shut-down-abruptly/">He even posted a farewell message to the users</a>:</p>
    <blockquote><p>”As always, all Empires eventually fall and today is the day that the {Removed} falls.</p>
    <p>After years of running CP hidden services, today is the day that I walk away. There are personal issues which my close friends have been made aware of that have forced me to make this decision.</p>
    <p>I will leave {Removed} (and it’s chat) as well as {Removed} up for the time being however if I host for you via {Removed} I suggest you start looking for a new hosting provider ASAP.</p>
    <p>I don’t like long awkward farewells, so… Goodbye :)</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>Lux.”</p></blockquote>
    <p>Shortly after the CP (child porn) website’s closedown, law enforcement authorities taken the man down in a joint action by the FBI, Australian Federal Police, Victoria Police’s Taskforce Astraea, Canadian police and Europol. Graham pleaded guilty to 13 child porn related charges.</p>
    <p>The question is that how this 23-year-old man become what he is. An Australian newspaper, <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/how-lux-became-a-recluse-and-found-child-porn-on-the-darknet-20160204-gmm1nb.html">Theage, has gathered some details</a> of Graham how he changed from an innocent 15-year-old boy to the administrator of a hurtcore child porn site. Here are a few important details from his life:</p>
    <p>”Matthew Graham was, according to his family, a normal suburban Melbourne boy until he was 15. He lived in Epping in the northern suburbs and went to Greensborough Primary School. Then he moved to South Morang and went to Epping Secondary College. He was quiet, and shy, but nothing unusual. His family was close. His mother was a school integration aide. Then through years nine and ten at high school, his defence lawyer David Gibson told the County Court on Thursday, Graham began ’shutting people out’. He had no social life at school, only one teenager he called a friend and &#8220;no interaction with his parents&#8221;, who became increasingly frustrated.”</p>
    <p>”Graham, now 23, has admitted 13 child pornography, child abuse and &#8220;hurtcore&#8221; charges relating to a secret network of websites he ran from his South Morang bedroom between 2012 and 2014. He became involved with Australian paedophile Peter Scully and a horrific sexual torture video series called Daisy&#8217;s Destruction, which Scully made and starred in. Graham has also admitted encouraging the rape and killing of a child in Russia and the rape of a disabled seven-year-old girl in Britain.”</p>
    <p>”He went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed social anxiety and gave him Zoloft. Graham did very well in his VCE and got into nanotechnology at LaTrobe University, but as soon as he got there he dropped out because he couldn&#8217;t cope.”</p>
    <p>”In his room he was teaching himself to build websites, hack websites and make security software for websites. This led him to the anonymous browser called Tor, which can access darknet sites without the user being traced. At first, he looked at drugs and weapons. Dr Deakin told the court this was not because he liked drugs or weapons, but to test the covert sites&#8217; security. Then he moved onto child pornography sites. Two things happened. Firstly, Graham perceived they were not very secure. He was able to offer advice to site administrators on child porn forums on how to make them more solid. His status rose. He became in-demand. Secondly the content on the child porn sites ’triggered some kind of sexual response’. He had never looked at child porn before and described himself as ’asexual’. Dr Deakin said he developed a &#8220;secondary paedophilia&#8221; after repeated exposure to the material and despite taking non-sexual photographs of his neighbours&#8217; children would not view children in the real world sexually.he began to use the material he was administering for his own gratification.”</p>
    <p>Graham was not just linked to Scully, but he was also in contact with former Adelaide childcare worker Shannon McCoole, also known as Skee, who sexually abused seven children and <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/08/11/australian-darkweb-pedo-site-admin-sentenced-to-35-years-in-jail/">sentenced to 35 years in jail</a>.</p>
