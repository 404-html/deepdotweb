    <p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/?s=Curtis+Green">Curtis Green</a>, the former employee of the Silk Road Marketplace, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/murdered-silk-road-employee-sentenced-to-time-served">was sentenced to time served</a>, 2 days and 4 years of supervised release, by Chief US District Judge Catherine C. Blake at Baltimore court. The man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Green was doing the customer support of the infamous Silk Road marketplace along with working as a moderator on the harm reduction part of the Silk Road forum. He was using the usernames of Chronicpain and Flush at the time.</p>
    <p>For a pretty long time, Green was thought to be dead since he was the Silk Road employee “implicated in an elaborate, and fake, murder-for-hire scheme”, that was created in part by a corrupt DEA agent.</p>
    <p>When asked, Green said this statement regarding his involvement with Silk Road:</p>
    <p>“I got involved in Silk Road because I was interested in Bitcoin and Silk Road was the biggest marketplace for Bitcoin. I also had an interest in harm reduction related to drug use.”</p>
    <p>Despite the fact that Green was only a moderator of the site, a heavily armed SWAT team and DEA agents had raided the man&#8217;s house and arrested Green in January 2013.</p>
    <p>Ross Ulbricht, the administrator of Silk Road who is now serving a life sentence, quickly learned that one of his staff members had been arrested. He suspected that Green would help the authorities. Ulbricht contacted one of his trusted drug dealer contacts, Nob, and asked him to kill Green for the sum of $40,000. Shortly after, Nob sent the former Silk Road admin photos of Green covered in Campbell’s Chicken &amp; Stars soup and victim of an apparent asphyxiation, proving the murder has been carried out successfully. What Ulbricht did not know at the time that Nob was not a drug dealer, he was Carl Mark Force IV, the corrupt DEA agent who had arrested Green.</p>
    <p>Similar to Ulbricht&#8217;s crowd-funding campaign, Green had launched one too to “fight dirty federal agents”. However, it was pretty unsuccessful since only 25$ was donated of the 50,000$ goal so the whole project had been cancelled.</p>
