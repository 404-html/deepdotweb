    <p><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/norml-canna-juice-donations-dark-web-pot-dealers">Recently, Canna-Juice, a dark net market vendor selling liquids to cannabis vaporizers, announced on Reddit that he is going to send a portion of his income to NORML (National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws), a marijuana legalization nonprofit.</a> Surprisingly, the non-profit company seems pretty happy about the drug dealer’s efforts. The original Reddit post of Canna-Juice goes by:</p>
    <p>“Beginning yesterday and running through the end of May we&#8217;ll be taking $5 from every order you place to help our friends at NORML (National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws).”</p>
    <p>On May 23 and 24, NORML will have its 2016 Congressional Lobby Day:</p>
    <p>“Hundreds of marijuana consumers, activists, patients and business owners are expected to attend a day-long training and informational conference on Monday and reconvene on The Hill Tuesday to personally lobby their elected members of the House of Representatives and Senate,” says the post from the organization’s blog.</p>
    <p>Canna-Juice also added this statement:</p>
    <p>“We&#8217;ll be making bi-weekly donations in the name of the [dark web markets] and will keep you updated on the campaigns [sic] success regularly.”</p>
    <p>Some users in the comment section (of Reddit) raised attention to the dangers that this action of the dark net vendor could raise:</p>
    <p>“Nice gesture, but you&#8217;re better off donating anonymously,” one user wrote. “The fact of the matter is that if the donations are traced to [dark web markets] it will do NORML more harm than good. You can take any ideological stance you want on this, but that&#8217;s the reality.”</p>
    <p>However, NORML does not consider this donation as an issue:</p>
    <p>“Be them illegal or taxed &#8216;cannabusinesses&#8217;, NORML welcomes their financial and in-kind donations to aid in the organization&#8217;s 45-year-old public advocacy campaign to end cannabis prohibition, and replace with a tax-n-regulate policy similar to alcohol products,” Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML, told Motherboard when asked about the case.</p>
    <p>This is not the first case when NORML has received funds from criminals. St. Pierre recalled an event in 1976 when the founder of NORML received “a pile of $20 bills equaling $10,000, donated from a group of cannabis smugglers, exhorting NORML to succeed in its stated mission to legalize the noble herb.”</p>
