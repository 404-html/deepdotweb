    <p>Police officers in Emlichheim <a href="http://www.gn-online.de/nachrichten/drogen-im-wert-von-100000-euro-in-neuenhaus-167123.html">arrested</a> two alleged drug dealers on September 9th. There is a chance that the 53 and 56-year-old men were selling drugs on the dark net since law enforcement authorities seized 37 letters full of drugs, ready for delivery.</p>
    <p>According to the police report, the men sent narcotics within Germany and internationally. During the search, authorities found two kilograms of amphetamine, 5275 ecstasy pills, 815 grams of cocaine and 135 LSD blotters. The sales value of the substances is believed to be around 100,000 Euros ($112,000).</p>
    <p>Patrol officers in Emlichheim had noticed an occupied car with two men. When they went to inspect the vehicle, they found “considerable amounts of drugs” and arrested the suspects.</p>
    <p>&#8220;In a subsequent general traffic control, officers found considerable amounts of different drugs in the car,&#8221; a police statement said.</p>
    <p>There has been plenty dark net-related drug busts in Germany, lately. The number increased, when a vendor named “Chemical Love” was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/17/dark-web-vendor-chemical-love-busted-50-kg-drugs-seized/">arrested</a> in April. During the search, police found 54kg amphetamines, 1.3 kg cocaine, 4 kg heroin and 25,000 ecstasy pills, however, this was not the end of the case. Earlier this month, German law enforcement authorities carried out a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/12/nationwide-raid-vendor-chemical-loves-customers-germany/">massive raid</a> on the dark web vendor’s customers where they arrested 63 suspects.</p>
    <p>The most significant dark net vendor in Germany was the 20-year-old Maximilian S. AKA “Shiny Flakes” who was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/11/vendor-bust-shiny-flakes-unknown-dutch-vendor/">arrested</a> on February 27, 2015. Police found massive amounts of drugs in the man’s house: about 320 kilograms of narcotics were seized. According to the law enforcement authorities, Shiny Flakes sold a total of 914 kilograms of substances on the internet (both on dark net marketplaces and on the clearnet). Maximilian S. was <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/07/shiny-flakes-sentenced-to-7-years/">sentenced</a> to seven years in youth prison for illegally trafficking large quantities of drugs by Leipzig District Court.</p>
