    <p>A 40-year-old man from Bavaria has been sentenced to four and a half years in prison for drug trafficking. According to investigators, the unnamed man bought $30,000 worth of drugs from darknet marketplaces. He then distributed the drugs throughout southern Bavaria.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15950 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/word-image-12.jpeg" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/word-image-12.jpeg 616w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/word-image-12-300x192.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px"/></p>
    <p>Investigators claimed, during court hearings in October, that the man operated between June 2013 and October 2015. He served as a middleman between the streets and the deepweb. Sources revealed that he accepted Bitcoin from local parties and would make orders on their behalf.</p>
    <p>The man placed orders and was compensated based on a predetermined commission rate. charges against the man were majorly based on 7 orders that totaled $30,000. During the first hearing, police officers claimed that many more orders were made but may have been intended for personal use.</p>
    <p>Drugs were delivered from the deepweb vendors to several locations. The man’s home in Altötting was one such location. Others went to post offices or “packet stations.” He then personally delivered and/or resold the substances in the Altötting and Mühldorf areas. Hashish, amphetamines and ecstasy tablets were the most common products. Kilograms of the drugs, investigators reported.</p>
    <p>Packages were intercepted by police at various postal stations across the country. The contents were “disassembled” and tested prior to repackaging. Current announcements have not clarified whether or not the real drugs were re-introduced into the mail stream. In the case where Canadian police <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/18/police-intercept-package-mail-containing-1kg-carfentanil/">intercepted the package containing 1kg of Carfentanil</a>, rock salt was substituted for the drug.</p>
    <p>Before the First Criminal Court of Traunstein, the man confessed to using aliases to purchase drugs from the deepweb. He admitted the aforementioned trafficking. The man refused to reveal any names of suppliers or customers. However, various news sources claimed that local law enforcement <a href="http://www.heimatzeitung.de/mobile/?cid=2252211">arrested several participants</a>. the roles played by the participants have not been revealed.</p>
    <p>While in the courtroom, the defendant displayed noticeable remorse. “The whole thing was an incredible bullshit, a total failure. It was the first time and will be the last time that I sit in court for something,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the end of the trial, the 40-year-old was charged with ten counts of narcotics trafficking. A source claimed that a prison term of 4 and a half years was a <a href="http://www.pnp.de/mobile/?cid=2253668">lenient penalty</a>. The same source claimed the self-confession helped the man’s cause. Outside witnesses claimed the man was a “good and solid living man.”</p>
    <p>“Small amounts of the ordered drugs were probably intended for his own consumption,” a source wrote. The man was not believed to have drug problems. Some orders were considered insignificant to law enforcement. The small, insignificant packages were either for personal use or sample packs for potential customers.</p>
    <p>A second case has been linked to same man. According to a local newspaper, the 40-year-old “misused the details” of third parties. Furthermore, his shipment was intercepted in Altoetting in October 2015. The package contained amphetamine, cocaine, and ecstasy. By October 2015, however, the accused was already in a detention center, awaiting his hearing.</p>
