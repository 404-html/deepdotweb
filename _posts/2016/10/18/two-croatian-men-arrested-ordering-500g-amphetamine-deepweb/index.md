    <p>In Bosnia, two men have been arrested for purchasing half a kilogram of amphetamines from the deepweb. The men, a 44-year-old and a 40-year-old, have continually been under police observation for drug trafficking, <a href="http://www.24sata.hr/news/uhitili-bracu-iz-cavtata-preko-interneta-su-narucivali-drogu-494509">according to a local source</a>.</p>
    <p>The Police Department of Dubrovnik-Neretva opened an investigation into the men based on undisclosed information. However, both men had prior criminal offenses relating to drug trafficking, unofficial sources disclose. The younger of the two men had several unrelated charges. One of which was disturbing the peace. <a href="http://www.dulist.hr/vlasnici-podebljih-dosjea-braca-sa-zvekovice-s-dark-weba-narucivali-drogu-u-cavtat/357069/">News outlets believed</a> these prior convictions were the driving force behind the investigation.</p>

    <p>Law enforcement disclosed that the men used bitcoin to purchase amphetamine from the deepweb. Two separate shipments of the drug were to be delivered in the Cavtat area, police claimed. According to the press release, police believed one man picked up the packages and then delivered the contents to the other man. Police naturally followed the man suspected of making the initial online transaction and picking the packages up.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old,<a href="http://dubrovacki.slobodnadalmacija.hr/vijesti/crna-kronika/clanak/id/429008/drogu-placao-bitcoinima"> the police report claims</a>, is responsible for the online transaction and package handling. The 40-year-old was the one who received the packages and likely prepared them for redistribution.</p>
    <p>Both suspects have been formally charged and are in custody at the detention center at the Dubrovnik-Neretva County Police Department.</p>
    <p>This case eerily mirrors one <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/24/suspect-arrested-ordering-130g-amphetamine-online/">happened previously this year</a>. The Dubrovnik-Neretva County Police Department started looking into an unidentified 31-year-old male for drug related crimes. He was suspected of illicit production of narcotics and of drug trafficking. By undisclosed methods, law enforcement was able to see packages the man had previously ordered. One of these packages contained 130g amphetamine.</p>
    <p>Officers discovered the time and date the next package would arrive. Undercover officers waited at the drop site and ultimately arrested the suspect. From news available to us, this man is also being held at the detention center at the Dubrovnik-Neretva County Police Department.</p>
    <p>Croatia is cracking down on the importation of drugs via postal services: in October, police <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deepdotweb.com%2F2016%2F10%2F01%2Fcroatian-police-arrest-suspects-intercepting-57g-ecstasy-shipment%2F">intercepted a 57g ecstasy shipment</a>. The package was noticed at the post office and a subsequent controlled delivery was performed. A search warrant was signed and a brief search of the recipients home led to the discovery of an accomplice. Scales were found along with several “items that are associated with crime,” <a href="http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Crna-kronika/Droga-stigla-postom-Mladic-iz-Bakra-uhicen-nakon-sto-je-preuzeo-posiljku-s-57-grama-ecstasyja">said a local news outlet</a>.</p>
    <p>From our article on the ecstasy interception:</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old, who had allegedly been suspected of drug drug trafficking, was charged unauthorized production and trafficking of drugs. His 26-year-old accomplice received charges related to aiding the commission of the crime. Both men are in custody and are awaiting trial at the Municipal Prosecutor’s Office.</p>
    <p>The General Police Directorate publicly announced a noticeable growth in the number of illicit substances passing through the post office.</p>
