    <p>In early 2016, Bavarian police received information on a currency counterfeiting operation in Geisenhausen. A thorough investigation ensued. The counterfeiting “workshop” was discovered in a garage owned by two German men: a 22-year-old and a 24-year-old.</p>
    <p>After the investigation, both men were arrested and remained in custody until the court date on October 12, 2016.</p>
    <p>The majority of the details of the case were released post-conviction. Little information had been released prior to the hearing at the regional court in Landshut.</p>
    <p>According to a local news source,<a href="http://www.idowa.de/inhalt.landshut-garagen-geldfaelscher-muessen-in-den-knast.deb6925b-d453-4ad6-a438-e3d26ae96c90.html"> the investigation began after a tip was made to the police</a>. The tipster, possibly the landlord, claimed two men spent an unusual amount of time in a garage. Trash bags were routinely carried from inside to a nearby, openly visible location. Other than to carry the trash bags, the men only left when their day’s work had been done. The aforementioned trash bags proved to be the tipping point.</p>

    <p>Police searched the bags and discovered an exorbitant amount of the remains of fake 50-euro notes. With enough evidence to search the garage, a full sweep was conducted. <a href="http://www.br.de/nachrichten/niederbayern/inhalt/geldfaelscher-prozess-landshut-urteil-100.html">Police are reported to have been amazed by the findings</a>.</p>
    <p>The garage was equipped with computers, three inkjet printers, and large quantities of paper designed for printing euros. Cutting tools, chemicals for the treatment of printed notes, and 50 counterfeit euros were also found.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15972 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/10/counterfeit2-jpeg.jpeg" alt="Counterfeit2.jpeg" srcset="/imgs/2016/10/counterfeit2-jpeg.jpeg 700w, /imgs/2016/10/counterfeit2-jpeg-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"/></p>
    <p>2,856 holograms were seized from the garage as well. The holograms, investigators discovered, were purchased off an unnamed darknet marketplace.</p>
    <p>A connection between the two men and the deepweb was then established. Based on several pieces of information and individual testimonies, investigators discovered the men sold the currency on darknet marketplaces. In the initial search, police officers found 200 postal documents that detailed online transactions. The documents revealed the country the fraudulent currency was shipped to as well as the listed recipient of each shipment.</p>
    <p>“It is already known that shipments of counterfeits have arrived with respective note numbers. To clarify further Gerechtshof ought and their reach, the investigation will continue for this purpose,” an LKA official said during the hearing.</p>
    <p>The men created 5,000 50-euro notes, prosecutors claimed.</p>
    <p>That would be $276,362 worth of counterfeit currency, if taken at face value. Investigators claim, however, that the notes sold at a rate of 5:1. Each 50-euro note sold for bitcoins worth 10-euros.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement agencies in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria are reported to be on high alert for these notes. Court documents revealed that 1,227 of the notes sold were delivered to these three areas alone.</p>
    <p>Statements made by the defendants clarified that the majority of the notes did not get distributed. The 22-year-old Daniel T. claimed to have spent 1,000 euros during a single evening at a nightclub. His attorney backs up this claim, adding that the man rented Lamborghinis with the money.</p>
    <p>Both men admitted to the allegations on the first day of the trial. Multiple parties noted their “cooperative spirit.” Sources claimed such cooperative spirit affected the mitigation.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old Daniel T. was convicted of commercial counterfeiting and possession of stolen goods. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. His accomplice, the 24-year-old Arthur K., was charged only with commercial counterfeiting. He received a sentence of three years and two months.</p>
    <p>Additional charges may follow.</p>
