    <p>Over the past 2 weeks, Bitcoin traded sideways for a 6 days below $640, before selling off to a rising support at $625. Over the past 4 days however, Bitcoin rallied 4% back to testing $650 &#8211; $655 resistance level, cruising through the weekend on a delectable bounce off support. Chinese exchanges made new highs, on the back off Yuan devaluation fears. At some point, China traded 50X more volumes than the US. Meanwhile, bitcoin fundamentals were stable, with no bad news, and all good news on Bitcoin core upgrades. I am Bullish, and when we make it past $650 (and maybe after a retest), brace for a BIG move.</p>

    <p>(A) highlights the past 2 weeks of price action. Price rallied up to $645, and met a resistance, consolidating sideways for a week before selling off to the rising trendline. This trendline has been respected since August 4, when markets sold off to $465 low, mostly due to the BitFinex $ 72 million hack. Despite the sell off, price gradually rose up the trendline, a reassuring sign, that the trend is well respected. The break out to $656 over the weekend, confirms that the trend is bullish. As of writing this price is at $652, forming what looks to be a bullish flag. A consolidation from the $656 high, before further upside.</p>

    <p>The chart above shows the uptrend since the August $465 low, visibly making higher highs and higher lows. This week price made two attempts at breaking above $652 resistance level, that dates back to the post halving triangle. Any sideways trend at this level is reasonable. Breaking $652 sets up target of $740. <img class="wp-image-16136 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cvyrg9iumaa77io-png.png" alt="CvYrG9IUMAA77Io.png" width="778" height="438" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cvyrg9iumaa77io-png.png 1200w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cvyrg9iumaa77io-png-300x169.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cvyrg9iumaa77io-png-1024x577.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px"/></p>
    <p>The long term BTC/CNY chart reaffirms the significance of $652. Chinese traders are likely looking at the next target of CNY 5,000 ($740), once resistance of CNY 4,240 is broken. “<em>Bitcoin’s gains are coinciding with a new bout of currency weakness in China, which accounts for about 90 percent of trading, as the yuan extended a six-year low. Trading volume climbed to an almost seven-month high of 5.5 million bitcoin on Sunday” </em><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-24/bitcoin-jumps-to-three-month-high-as-yuan-weakness-fuels-buying">Bloomberg</a></p>
    <p><strong>BITCOIN FUNDAMENTALS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin B2B payments rise to $40 million Y-o-Y</strong></p>
    <p>Cross border business settlements via bitcoin went up tenfold in 2016, according to Digital Currency Group. DCG, an investor in digital currency technology startups, said monthly volumes rose from nearly $5 million to $40 million from January to October 2016. Unocoin, BitPesa and Align Commerce, part of DCG’s portfolio companies attended the event in New York graced by 120 blockchain entrepreneurs and 180 investors.Barry Silbert, Founder and CEO, also tipped Bitcoin as a store of value to re-emerge as the top theme in 2017.</p>
    <p><strong>European Central Bank&#8217;s Fears Bitcoin Threatens control over Money Supply</strong></p>
    <p>According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-bitcoin-eu-idUSKCN12I1HC">Reuters</a>, the ECB is worried that digital currencies like Bitcoin, may one day threaten its monopoly over money supply in the Eurozone. Unlike the Euro, Bitcoin’s monetary supply is fixed. The ECB has been on a paper printing binge, sending interest rates down below zero.</p>
    <p><em>&#8220;The reliance of economic actors on virtual currency units, if substantially increased in the future, could in principle affect the central banks’ control over the supply”</em>Eliminating cash has been a top agenda for the ECB, while perpetuating a negative interest rate policy environment. The legal opinion recommended EU legislative bodies should not promote the widespread use of virtual currency, and should emphasize VCs lack legal status of currency or money.</p>
    <p><strong>UK Licensed Gambling Site now Accepts Bitcoin</strong></p>
    <p>NetBet, a European gambling site partnered with BitPay to allow the merchant to accept bitcoin payments. NetBet joins an increasing number of online betting merchants accepting bitcoin. In August 2016, the UK Gambling and licensing commission gave a <a href="http://calvinayre.com/2016/08/03/business/uk-gambling-commission-okays-bitcoin-online-licensees/">green light</a> to licensed firms to accept digital currencies such as Bitcoin, classified under cash and cash equivalents. According to BitPay’s <a href="https://blog.bitpay.com/netbet-accepts-bitcoin/">press release</a>, “<em>we&#8217;ve worked closely with NetBet to ensure that the addition of this new payment method meets their existing UK Gambling Commission regulatory requirements.”</em></p>
    <p>The trend here is obvious, and it is likely that more online gambling firms will start accepting bitcoin as a payment option.</p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin Weekly Price Forecast</strong></p>
    <p>This week, I expect the price of Bitcoin to steadily consolidate to a bottom. $640 level should hold. I am bullish over the next 2 months. The sentiment in markets is bullish too, closely resembling the feverish excitement before the July halving.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-16137 aligncenter" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/high-png.png" alt="HIgh.png" width="906" height="421" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/high-png.png 1160w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/high-png-300x139.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/high-png-1024x476.png 1024w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/high-png-272x125.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px"/></p>
    <p>This chart from <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/u/ZarNegar/">ZarNegar</a> shows what to expect using the hourglass technique. Targets of $1160 if price keeps rising. ZarNegar has a great recording of forecasting long term moves. 2 years ago he <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/MW7ZZW0C-BTC-is-Falling/">forecasted</a> a fall to $133 on December 2014 when bitcoin traded at $331.</p>
    <p><em>“there are two choices. The first option. $ 500 is an increase to 1160 And the second option. $ 500 is likely to fall to 160 The first choice. Is greater than the second. Good luck”</em>My modest target is $850.</p>
