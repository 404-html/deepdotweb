    <p>An unnamed group of security researches claims to have intercepted configuration files used in the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/suspected-russian-hackers-allegedly-targeting-85-tech-giants-including-amazon-apple-pay-steam-1582896">attacks against a number of the U.S.’ big names in the Technology industry</a>. The group says that the hackers were using a Russian server and spoke Russian in their online communications.</p>
    <p>The hackers are suspected to have been stealing user information from more than 85 companies. American Airlines, Apple Pay, AT&amp;T, DropBox, Amazon, Ebay, PayPal, Steam and Wells Fargo were among the names.</p>
    <p>Ed Alexander is a dark net investigator who said when the hackers targeted Apple Pay the captured credit card numbers and identities for users. Hackers also got away with personal information to security questions.</p>
    <p>“When I saw this file earlier this week, I took my iPhones off Apple Pay,” Alexander stated.</p>
    <p>He went on to state that he found custom cyberattack files that were designed purely for targeting each company. They contained configurations for a black market cracking tool, Sentry MBA. Sentry is in popular demand among hackers.</p>

    <p>Cybersecurity Researchers said:</p>
    <p>“In the case of credential stuffing, the most commonly used standalone management tool we have observed enabling attacks is called Sentry MBA. A Sentry configuration file contains, among other items, the URL for a website’s login page, field markers to help navigate form elements, and rules for valid password constructions. A number of forums offer a wide variety of working configurations for various websites.”</p>
    <p>The hacker’s identity still remains unclear, as well as if they are sponsored by a government or not. It is also unknown as to whether the hackers are in it for profit, or if it is part of a well-planned cyberespionage operation.</p>
