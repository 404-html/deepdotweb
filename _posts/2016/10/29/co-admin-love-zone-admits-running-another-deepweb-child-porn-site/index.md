    <p>In 2014, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/07/20/police-infiltrated-darknet-forum-hunt-pedophiles/">Taskforce Argos took down the child porn site The Love Zone</a> (TLZ) and captured Britain’s “worst pedophile ever. The site’s administrator, Shannon McCoole, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/02/02/jailed-child-porn-admin-testifies-against-co-admin/">testified against several co-admins</a> following his arrest. One man, a 33-year-old from Bornholm, was just discovered to be one such co-admin while running another child porn site.</p>
    <p>In February 2016, Danish police raided the home of the Bornholm man, seizing 56,594 images and 3,174 videos. All images and videos were contained on terabytes of encrypted storage mediums. Investigators, at the time of this article, had not yet recovered everything on the drives.</p>
    <p>After McCoole’s arrest, the man testified against many of the co-admins and provided login passwords to the site. The passwords alone contributed to the arrests of 23 members of TLZ, both viewers and admins alike. The arrest of a 48-year-old from Denmark, in late 2015, made headlines in several publications; when the 48-year-old was on on trial, McCoole testified against the man specifically.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old, McCoole claimed, was one of the largest sources of child pornorgraphy on in the world. “He helped me find original child pornography material. In general, TL [the 48-year-old] had seen so much material that if he had not seen something before, then it had to be new,” McCoole said. The 48-year-old was arrested with 100,000 images and 600 videos in his possession. He was <a href="http://www.domstol.dk/VestreLandsret/nyheder/domsresumeer/Pages/7aarsfaengseliomfattendepaedofili-sag.aspx">sentenced to seven years in prison</a>.</p>
    <p>Within a month of TL’s trial closing, the 33-year-old from Bornholm was raided and arrested by Danish police. Police arrested the 33-year-old in connection with TLZ and information provided by the <a href="http://www.domstol.dk/randers/nyheder/domsresumeer/Pages/Domip%C3%A6dofilisagmod48-%C3%A5rigmandfraRanders.aspx">aforementioned 48-year-old</a>.</p>
    <p>In the courtroom, the 33-year-old acknowledged many of the charges against him. His acknowledgement made the case more difficult for prosecutors. He acknowledged his <a href="http://www.tv2bornholm.dk/?newsID=120226&amp;cache=manual">role as a co-admin of TLZ</a> where he provided and curated media. Many of the images in his possession came directly from the previously convicted 48-year-old. Despite acknowledging and, in part, admitting his administrative role, he pleaded not guilty.</p>
    <p>Ulrik Sjølin Pedersen, the man’s lawyer, claimed any activity associated with TLZ ended when TLZ was taken down. His client, the lawyer told reporters, would like to plead guilty but only if the circumstances are right.</p>
    <p>While discussing TLZ administration, the 33-year-old spoke of another darknet child pornography site that had previously been unknown to Danish law enforcement. The Bornholm man spoke of being the owner and administrator of a Scandinavian-only site called DanBB. He revealed that the site shared many similarities with TLZ, including that members must upload unique content once a week. In contrast with TLZ, all members of DanBB must be Scandinavian-speaking. No other languages were permitted.</p>
    <p>The images and videos on the site were shared with TLZ. However, prosecutor Pernille Munch said that much of the media was of a more serious variety. The overwhelming majority of images depicted sexual acts against children instead of a mixed bag of content.</p>
    <p>Munch said the hearing only lasted two hours due to the defendant’s cooperation but the prosecution is unsure how to proceed. He will receive a minimum prison sentence of two years, regardless of the changes that may occur. The defendant is also being charged with possession of cannabis but this is unlikely to have an impact on sentencing.</p>
    <p>Two more members of deepweb child porn sites are expected to be in a courtroom for hearings within a month. A 35-year-old and a 41-year-old have been arrested in connection with TLZ and similar sites. One of the suspects will be testified against by McCoole, via video conference.</p>
    <p>No convictions have made.</p>
