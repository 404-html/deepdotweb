    <p>The hacker called “Peace” or “Peace_of_Mind” has <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/drama-on-the-underground-hacking-scene-as-black-hats-hack-each-other-508910.shtml">breached</a> one of his rivals’, website.</p>
    <p>Peace was known for selling stolen data dumps from sites, such as VK.com, Tumblr, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/10/yahoo-aware-hacker-selling-200-million-user-credentials-dark-web/">Yahoo</a>, <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/22/insights-peace-seller-leaked-linkedin-database/">LinkedIn</a>, Fling.com, and the Linux Mint forums. The hacker is known on dark net sites like (currently defunct) <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/therealdeal-market/">TheRealDeal marketplace</a> and the Hell Forum where he is one of the key members.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, “w0rm”, the cybercriminal Peace just hacked, is mostly known for breaching US media websites like the Wall Street Journal, Vice, and CNET. However, security experts know the hacker by running his website where he regularly publishes proof-of-concept code for recent security vulnerabilities, and data dumps from hacked sites. w0rm’s website has an active discussions forum, where hackers can discuss topics and sell knowledge or tools.</p>
    <p>Users trying to access w0rm&#8217;s website on Sunday were greeted with a message: &#8220;~Hacked by Peace of Mind and prometheus for [expletive] with Hell Forum.&#8221; The site also included the “supposed” photo and the personal details of w0rm.</p>
    <p>w0rm has been hacked before two times: in October 2014 and in September 2015. It seems Peace posted the same data from the previous doxes to the hacker’s site.</p>
    <p>Peace confirmed to Softpedia that he has hacked w0rm’s website, and also mentioned why he did it.</p>
    <p>&#8220;[w0rm] was reporting [vulnerabilities] of websites I had access to,&#8221; Peace wrote. &#8220;I ended losing access cause of him. Thats [sic] a personal reason. also he scammed a couple of ppl I know.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Peace did not like the fact that w0rm was stealing content from the Hell Forum, which is a closed community for high-end cybercriminals. w0rm re-posted the data on his website for anyone to access angering the wrong people. In the past few years, w0rm posted the leaked content of hacking forums to his site, this resulted in two doxings in the last two years.</p>
    <p>Peace did not stop after hacking w0rm’s website, he also dumped the site’s entire database online. The main part of the data dump was the forum’s database, which consists of user account details, passwords and private messages.</p>

    <p>The leaked data included the Hunter exploit kit’s source code. Hunter is not as famous as Neutrino, Nuclear, Angler, RIG, or Magnitude, however, it is one of the few active exploit kits.</p>
