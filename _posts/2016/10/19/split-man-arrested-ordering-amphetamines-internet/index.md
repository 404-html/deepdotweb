    <p>Split Man Arrested For Ordering Amphetamines From The Internet</p>
    <p>Split Police <a href="http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/splicanin-narucio-amfetamin-preko-interneta-policija-ga-uhvatila-nakon-sto-mu-je-isporucen-paket/923793.aspx">arrested</a> a 22-year-old for ordering amphetamines from the internet. He was arrested after he received his package.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old was reported for the production and trafficking of illicit substances and was detained for further questioning at the State Attorney’s Office.</p>
    <p>According to the State Attorney’s Office the suspect allegedly ordered at least 116 grams of amphetamine from a vendor in Germany. Law enforcement authorities assume the man ordered the drugs from a dark net marketplace, however, this statement has not been proved yet.</p>
    <p>The substance was agreed to be delivered to the 22-year-old’s home address, however, local police have been alerted, which resulted in the man’s arrest.</p>
    <p>Law enforcement authorities found an additional 1.2 grams of marijuana in the package. At the home of the suspect, police found five bags containing 36 grams of marijuana, four bags with 13 grams of hash and a bag with 10 grams of amphetamines.</p>
    <p>Croatian police have been quite active in the past month regarding dark net busts. The most recent was the arrest of two men who were receiving a <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/01/croatian-police-arrest-suspects-intercepting-57g-ecstasy-shipment/">shipment</a> of 57 grams of “Orange Amsterdam tulips” (ecstasy). Police performed a controlled delivery on the two men. After authorities arrested a 27-year-old when he tried to pick up the shipment, they realized there was another person involved in the drug activity. A 26-year-old Croatian man was serving as an accomplice for his partner, he was also detained, but the charges against him were of a lesser nature. According to Croatian law, if only drugs are involved, the suspects would be charged “only” with the possession of illegal substances. However, the situation was different this time, police found two digital scales and “items that are associated with crime,” resulting in the duo charged with other offenses too. The 27-year-old was charged with unauthorized production and trafficking of illegal substances while the 26-year-old man received charges related to aiding the commission of the crime. Both men were remanded in custody and are awaiting trial at the Municipal Prosecutor’s Office.</p>
    <p>Another case in the same country involved a 31-year-old whose illegal <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/09/24/suspect-arrested-ordering-130g-amphetamine-online/">drug activity</a> has been spotted by the Dubrovnik-Neretva County Criminal Police Department. Soon after the investigation started, law enforcement authorities discovered the man had purchased at least 130 grams of amphetamines from the dark net. Police waited at the shipping address and immediately arrested the suspect on August 24 when he tried to pick up the package. The 31-year-old is currently being held in a detention center in Dubrovnik-Neretva County.</p>
    <p>It looks like Croatian law enforcement authorities are getting aware of the dark net drug activity in the country. The previously mentioned cases show how they act when they suspect someone of ordering illegal substances from the dark web. Local police used the same method in all three arrests (one of the favorite technique of law enforcement authorities around the world): controlled delivery. Although, the question how authorities detected the drug activity in the cases remains unknown.</p>
