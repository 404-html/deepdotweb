    <p>A <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/dark-net-market-comparison-chart/">Dark Net</a> researcher, Ed Alexander says that over 85 major technology companies like Amazon and Apple Pay have been hacked by a Russian based hacking group.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.hackread.com/dark-net-russian-hackers-hit-us-firms/">The group is suspected of hacking major firms</a> such as American Airlines, PayPal, Uber, Amazon, Apple Pay, AT&amp;T, DropBox, and others.</p>
    <p>Alexander’s report stated that several Russian servers were used for the “large-scale” attack, as well as using the Russian language in communications. These two key factors are what leads him to believe the group is Russian based.</p>
    <p>An earlier report by Alexander shared that during the Apple Pay hack, the attackers were able to obtain customers credit cards numbers as well as what he described as full identities.</p>
    <p>He identified custom attack files that were designed to target each company specifically. Each contained its own configuration for Sentry MBA; which is a popular black market credential stuffing software.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-15705 aligncenter" src="/imgs/2016/10/word-image-5.jpeg" width="721" height="397" srcset="/imgs/2016/10/word-image-5.jpeg 999w, /imgs/2016/10/word-image-5-300x165.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /></p>
    <p>Identities and links to any foreign governments have not been found yet. Motives for the attacks are still unknown as well. If the attacks were for monetary gain, the information should be available on <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">DMNs</a> pretty soon. If it’s not to score some cash from a sale on the dark net, it’s part of a well thought out, planned cyber-attack. In June, Alexander released reports saying that hackers had hacked Global Banking System and were able to now alter data for fraudulent money transfers and card fraud.</p>
    <p>This isn’t the first time Russia has made hacking headlines. Recent reports of Russian based hackers leaking the World Anti-Doping Agency information that exposed Olympic athletes using banned performance enhancing drugs.</p>
