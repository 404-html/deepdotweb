    <p>Those of you who use Coin tumblers that charge them up to 3% of their transaction amount might want to try this new feature on <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay/">Alphabay Market</a>, as their homepage states:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Alphabay can now safely be used as a <b>coin tumbler</b>! This means that no level of blockchain analysis can prove that your coins come from Alphabay since we use our own obfuscation technology. Making a deposit and withdrawing after is now a way to tumble your coins and break the link to the source of the funds. Since tumbling is not illegal, and since we leave no paper trail, you now have ironclad plausible deniabilty with your Bitcoins.</p></blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay/">Alphabay&#8217;s</a> withdrawal fee is a fixed to 0.001 BTC contrary to most mixer who charge up to 3% from the transaction amount, and allows you to input up to 5 different addresses for a single withdrawal &#8211; each withdrawal will be randomly split across those addresses along with an optional random delay in sending of up to 24 hours:</p>

    <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Alphabay Support later made this official announcement:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Alphabay can now safely be used as a <strong>coin tumbler!</strong> This means that no level of blockchain analysis can prove that your coins come from Alphabay since we use <strong>our own obfuscation technology.</strong> <strong>Making a deposit and withdrawing after is now a way to tumble your coins</strong> and break the link to the source of the funds. Since <strong>tumbling is not illegal</strong>, and since we leave no paper trail, you now have ironclad plausible deniability with your Bitcoins.</p>
    <p><strong>Why tumble/mix?</strong> Tumbling (mixing) your coins is a popular way to <strong>erase traces of your bitcoins coming from your activities.</strong> Using AlphaBay&#8217;s bitcoin tumbling/mixing you can <strong>easily add layer of security &amp; privacy</strong> to your operations and <strong>block attempts</strong> to uncover them. Regardless of who you are or what you do in the deep web, it is <strong>today essential to use tumblers to hide the origin of the bitcoins</strong> and build <strong>perfect plausible deniability.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Why use AlphaBay&#8217;s Bitcoin Tumbling/Mixing?</strong> We have invested many hours researching, testing and configuring our code &amp; infrastructure to come up with <strong>our own obfuscation technology built from scratch</strong> which allows <strong>true tumbling of coins</strong> to happen while giving you flexible options. For example, you can <strong>send bitcoins to multiple addresses</strong> and <strong>set time delay (/range) of sending</strong> to best fit your needs.</p>
    <p><strong>What are the fees?</strong> We do not charge any additional fees for tumbling/mixing your coins apart from our regular &amp; small withdraw fee for all accounts of 0.001 BTC.</p>
    <p><strong>How does AlphaBay profit if there are no fees?</strong> AlphaBay is the largest darknet market and has a very big user base which results in many problems such as banks/LE/researchers identifying our hot wallets and analyzing the information to disrupt existing business networks. By combining everyones bitcoins and shuffling them using our obfuscation technology, we are able to create a <strong>working layer of privacy</strong> in terms of deposits/withdraws within AlphaBay marketplace. The technology and concept work at their full potential only when there are multiple users depositing/withdrawing &#8211; thus <strong>by using AlphaBay casually for purchases/vending, you contribute to the privacy and security of everyone involved.</strong></p></blockquote>
