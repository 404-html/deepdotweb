    <p>A hacker <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/hacker-breaches-porn-network-advertises-user-data-on-dark-web">gained access to the porn network</a> Team Skeet and Paper Street Media (PSM), he is selling the login credentials, names, both physical and IP addresses of around 237,000 users on Dream Market under the username of TheNeoBoss. When asked about the purpose of his actions, the hacker stated:</p>
    <p>“I want to publicly shame them (the users) for their poor practices.”</p>
    <p>Some of the sold data also include the credit card details of the users, according to TheNeoBoss. The hacker&#8217;s ad on Dream Market costs 0.962 bitcoins (around $400) and goes by:</p>
    <p>“By purchasing this database, you will basically have free porn accounts for life, or you could sell them separately.”</p>
    <p>When Motherboard notified Jamal Hussein, the CTO of PSM, he told them in an email:</p>
    <p>“This is not a live breach. The data is from a breach that happened in 2008. We were asked for a ransom, didn&#8217;t pay it, made security updates and have not had any issues since. There was no credit card info taken and all accounts are no longer valid for our members area. We work with a high-quality security firm and have had no reports or issues with any breaches recently.”</p>
    <p>After that, Steven Eisenberg, the company&#8217;s lawyer continued the conversation:</p>
    <p>“Once a username is created PSM never blocks it out; however, once it expires, the user can no longer access the site. This would explain your results. As previously advised, the purported breach occurred approximately eight years ago, nothing ever came of the purported breach and PSM added additional security measures to its site. PSM is not aware of any other such issues.”</p>
    <p>According to TheNeoBoss, the stolen data were obtained by SQL injection, an established attack method many sites are vulnerable to.</p>
