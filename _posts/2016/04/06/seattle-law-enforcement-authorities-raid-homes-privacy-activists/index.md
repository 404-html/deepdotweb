    <p>On the morning of March 30, the condo of Jan Bultmann and David Robinson, both privacy activists, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/seattle-police-raid-home-privacy-activists-who-maintain-tor-anonymity-network-node-1552524">was raided by the Seattle Police Department</a> (SPD) with a search warrant looking for child pornography materials. The pair was operating exit nodes for the Tor network and this is not the first raid by the law enforcement authorities in the US on this kind of nodes, they tend to continue their activities on privacy activists.</p>
    <p>At the end of the house raid, police found no child porn on the couple&#8217;s electronic devices, seized no assets and arrested no one. The experience left Bultmann and Robinson outraged since &#8220;hints and comments [were] made about their cars, their jobs, their histories&#8230; revealing that they were thoroughly researched&#8221;.</p>
    <p>According to a study from King&#8217;s College London, 57% of the domains on the dark web were found as facilitating illegal activities. Illegal activities include the sale of drugs, firearms, offering hacker services, child porn, and so on. This could easily make the police confused, that&#8217;s why they often raid the places of Tor exit node hosts.</p>
