    <p>Bitcoin is still an attractive sphere for investment, despite the fact that financiers and developers switched their attention to the blockchain. In the last year alone, venture capital investments in cryptocurrency start-ups reached a record level.</p>

    <p>The sphere of cryptocurrency is interesting primarily for small and medium-sized investors, not global corporations. According to the head of the London Ledger Partners Jeremy Miller, up to 90% of the Bitcoin capitalization falls on family investment companies. In comparison with other assets, the digital currency brings them big profits.</p>

    <p>How soon will the project be justified?</p>
    <p>What start-ups are beneficial to the investor?</p>

He is willing to share his own investing experiences at <a href="http://bitcoinconf.eu/">Blockchain &amp; Bitcoin Conference</a>, which will take place in Prague on 19 May 2016.</p>

He writes books and columns, is an author of a book on Bitcoin, a member of the Qualitative Research Consultants Association (QRCA). He consults entrepreneurs and invests in start-ups associated with digital currencies and blockchain technology.</p>
