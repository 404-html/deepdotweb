    <p>Yeah, exit scams are not really news, but the tradition says we must post the obligatory gone pic:</p>

    <p>Nobody knows why, so do yourself a favor and ignore the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NucleusMarket/comments/4ffr6f/nucleus_was_hacked/" target="_blank">trolls</a> &amp; meaningless meth fueled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/4fiy1g/this_is_why_ive_been_saying_that_nucleus_owner/" target="_blank">walletexplorer inspection</a> posts you read on Reddit and the news articles who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NucleusMarket/comments/4ffr6f/nucleus_was_hacked/" target="_blank">quotes them</a> as if they were real, the fact that we still see those is almost insulting. That aside, the bottom line is that Nucleus, until last week the second largest market (after <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/16/solved-these-are-the-most-popular-dark-net-markets/" target="_blank">Alphabay</a>) seems to be down since the 13th April, unannounced, and we know what that usually means.</p>

    <p>I trust that the more experienced DNM users who already experienced the many market take downs, hacks and exit scams since 2013 know the drill by now and just move on to the next market or direct dealing. But for those of you who are still not sure where to go, here are some options and practical advice:</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Looking for vendor &#8220;X&#8221; contact details?</strong></span></p>
