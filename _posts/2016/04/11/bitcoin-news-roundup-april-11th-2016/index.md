    <p>This week, there was a variety of Bitcoin news across the board, most of it was good. Here is a recap of some of the week’s headlines.<strong><br/>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong>REGULATION:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin Startup Circle acquires Electronic Money License</strong></p>
    <p>Circle, a payment app that uses bitcoin as a backend payment wire, got approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK. The Goldman backed start up, to the tune of $50 million, has pried open the pandora’s box for virtual currency companies to go mainstream. To ease regulation and fast track the license, the government is housing Circle under its Innovation Hub, according to an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/dealbook/bitcoin-start-up-gets-an-electronic-money-license-in-britain.html">article</a> on the New York TImes.</p>
    <p>Harriett Baldwin, the British economic secretary to the treasury said these actions  <em>“prove our decision to introduce the most progressive, forward-looking regulatory regime is paying off and cements our status as the world’s fintech capital.”</em></p>
    <p>Notably, the startup was the first company to acquire the BitLicense from New York.</p>
    <p><strong>BANKING</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Barclays partners with Circle on Bitcoin enabled payments</strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialTimes/status/717563465766998017">The Financial Times</a> broke the news of a major European Bank officially allowed a digital currency startup access on its infrastructure. Circle will use bitcoin as a backend to enable customers to transfer dollar, sterling or euros funds to other app users. The app links user debit cards and Bitcoin’s public ledger, the blockchain, to do away the need for a bank clearing system.</p>
    <p>Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Co-founder envisions a mainstream financial use of the blockchain. FT quoted him saying</p>
    <p><em>“financial services industry did not fully realise the potential of the open-source blockchain, concentrating instead on developing its own closed versions based on similar technology”</em></p>
    <p><strong>E-COMMERCE</strong></p>
    <p><strong>OpenBazaar, decentralized marketplace opens for business</strong></p>
    <p>The first release of much awaited <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/06/23/openbazaar-a-decentralized-alternative/">Open Bazaar</a> came out this week. OB1, a decentralized peer to peer market, makes use of bitcoin as a currency, enabling online trade with no need for a third party like Amazon. Project Lead, CEO Hoffman, spoke <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/openbazaar-released-decentralized-bitcoin-marketplace-now-live-and-ready-for-business-1459793756">Bitcoin Magazine</a> on what to expect of this first iteration</p>
    <p><em>“This version is complete from end to end to allow purchase of physical, digital goods and services either directly or moderated.” </em></p>
    <p>Other features include rating purchases, reputation scores at the basic level and encrypted chat capability for communication on trades. Already, users are reporting successful trades for bitcoin merchandise, trezor hardware wallets and marijuana. Perhaps why sensationalist media has been quick to brand it <em>‘Decentralized Silk Road’</em></p>
    <p><strong>CONSENSUS LEDGERS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>R3CEV Unveils Distributed Ledger named ‘Corda’</strong></p>
    <p>Bank consortium R3CEV, a startup that brought together some of the largest banks to collaborate on a consensus ledger for financial services, unveiled its product Corda. <a href="http://bankinnovation.net/2016/04/r3cev-unveils-corda-its-distributed-ledger-product/">Bank Innovation</a>, reported Richard Gendal, CTO of the project, talking up its details at Europe’s Money20/20 conference, intentionally holding back on calling it a blockchain. He said</p>
    <p><em>“Corda has no unnecessary global sharing of data: only those parties with a legitimate need to know can see the data within an agreement,” </em></p>
    <p>It is a tailored consensus ledger, and participating financial firms will begin trialing it in 3 weeks, together with Microsoft, the latest giant to hop on board the project.</p>
    <p><strong>BANKING CRISIS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Kenyan Bank suffers Social Media triggered Deposit Run  </strong></p>
    <p><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/82a417f0-ff12-11e5-9cc4-27926f2b110c.html?ftcamp=published_links%2Frss%2Fcompanies_banks%2Ffeed%2F%2Fproduct">The Financial Times</a> reported a banking crisis that’s quietly taking place in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. A bank run on Chase Bank Kenya, triggered panic across the country, as citizens questioned the state of the country’s banking sector. Reports say depositors queued outside the lenders branches, hoping to salvage the little they could withdraw, currently capped at $250.</p>
    <p>The country’s Central Bank has</p>
    <p><em>“offered to extend emergency support on Sunday to any institution that faces liquidity problems through no fault of its own amid rising depositor anxiety about the health of the financial services sector”</em></p>
    <p>These events are relevant to bitcoin, as the regulator of one of East Africa’s largest economy, made a <a href="https://www.centralbank.go.ke/index.php/news/464-public-on-virtual-currencies-such-as-bitcoin">public notice</a> last year urging citizens to refrain from bitcoin and virtual currencies. However, through the eyes of the law, bitcoin is undefined. Since then, volumes on peer to peer market localbitcoins, have made consistent highs on weekly volumes, upto $50,000 a week as per <a href="https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/KES">coindance</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>MMM Global Ponzi that uses Bitcoin shuts down</strong></p>
    <p>MMM Global, a replica of a ponzi scheme ran by Sergei Mavrodi in 90s Russia, has been using bitcoin to fund and pay out sums to its growing network. Spanning as far a South Africa, Kenya and the Philippines, speculators believe it partly fueled last years’ price run up to $504.</p>
    <p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mmm-global-cant-sustain-bitcoin-scheme/">Bitcoin.com</a> reported the scheme is winding down, no longer sustainavle after manking an announcement on its website.</p>
    <p><em>“In their “farewell” message, the MMM Global team mentions how they can no longer afford to pay out 100% profit every single month for every member. A 30% gain should be sustainable. . .”</em></p>
    <p><strong>BITCOIN PROTOCOL</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin Classic Hashing power drops to 5.2% of total</strong></p>
    <p>This week, hashing power backing the bitcoin classic blocksize increase proposal dropped to 72 PH/s, 5.2% of the 1385 PH/s total. Some of the support behind this hard fork proposal to increase from 1Mb to 2MB, expressed frustration on the Bitcoin_Classic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin_Classic/comments/4e4nhp/were_officially_back_to_under_5/">sub reddit</a>.</p>
    <p>“<em>Say what you want, we won&#8217;t win this fight. Core has already won and 2MB blocks will only happen when the Core devs finally decide it&#8217;s time to switch.”</em></p>
    <p>Bitcoin Core has made several announcements this week, that show there is progress in development of segregated witness, an alternative soft block size increase proposal with other features</p>
