    <p>Today, we’re going to look at the operational details of something many DNM buyers dread – the controlled delivery or warrant service. “Its been X days since I ordered something heavy, do you think I’m gonna get a controlled delivery?”</p>
    <p>This is not an all-inclusive tale by any stretch, it doesn’t touch on the US at all, it concentrates on Australia &#8211; for the simple fact that they’ve been kind enough to tell us, in graphic, precise details, often with photos, all about how they do business – what they find, how its concealed, its all their. Big shout out to the Australian Border Force (the new name for Australian Customs and Border Protection’s recent merger with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship) for providing the majority of the source information on this article. Let’s get on with a few select case studies.<br/>
    In October of 2014, the clever kids at Australian Customs managed to pick up <a href="http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/printer-cartridges-found-to-contain-meth-not-toner">seven kilos of meth concealed in printer toner cartridges,</a> as it entered the country. If you, dear reader, didn’t already know, toner is pretty hard for x-rays scanners, like those used by Customs around the world, to penetrate reliably. Based on folk lore which goes with this assumption about carbon being able to mess with X-rays, many a small time smuggler packs their goods in carbon paper, thinking its going to help obscure their goods. If anything, seeing a thin sheet of carbon paper such as used to be use for duplicating typewritten documents on an X-ray is going to arouse suspicion. Carbon paper stories aside, Customs then held off doing a controlled delivery of the/arrest of the recipient, listed as a 27 year old Hong Kong national, until November 6 – a turnaround time of at least a week, if not more, from detection to pick up. On this one, it’s a little ambiguous on when they actually detected the package, and whether the target held off coming to pick up their goods after being notified when they arrived, but its food for thought, and a good primer to some of the other, more detailed stuff we’ll be seeing as we progress.</p>
    <p>Here we have one where things are more clear cut &#8211; 26 September, 2014, Australian Customs’ <a href="http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/two-men-try-to-import-methamphetamine-in-audio-equipment">super X-ray vision powers help them rip 2 kilos of meth out of a couple of car amplifiers</a>, the Feds get involved, and the controlled delivery takes place at a post office (not a drop off at home – they left a ‘come get your signed-for mail’ card in their mailbox) 1 October, 2014. That’s an impressive turnaround time, with the goods hitting Customs’ import stream and the illicit contents being detected (tracked or not, we can’t be sure here, but if its signed for/needed a post office visit as was the case, my money is on tracked) and the controlled delivery being pulled off, was 6 days, including the day it the goods were detected (a Friday), a weekend, and the day the CD itself was pulled off. Pretty impressive speed in this instance.</p>
    <p>So its clear that controlled deliveries on drugs are a thing, and a big thing at that. What else can you buy on a DNM which could lead to a controlled deliver? Well, who remembers one of the long dead BlackMarketReloaded’s more prolific gun dealers, or as he’s known to his mother and father, Adam Bunger? He’s known to the US Federal Government as both, as you can see from the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/bowling-green-kentucky-man-guilty-shipping-firearms-internationally">ATF</a> and with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdky/pr/bowling-green-kentucky-man-guilty-shipping-firearms-internationally">Justice Department as a whole</a>, and sent a gun to Australia in an Xbox, or a karaoke machine, depending on whose version of events your believe. According to the Australians, they <a href="http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/stay-out-of-the-firing-line-of-online-black-markets">detected a 9mm hidden not in an Xbox, but in a karaoke machine, on 1 June, 2013</a>&#8230; Which is odd, because the <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/foreign-gun-sales">ATF’s criminal complaint</a> said that the Australian feds had done an analysis of the piece on 28 June, 2013, and their affidavit includes a now, alas, deceased tracking number. The timeline suggests that the gun arrived in Australia on 21 June, 2013, was detected at some point between 21 and 28 June, at which point Customs handed over their find to the feds for further investigation. The affidavit sets out that the Australian feds were in touch with the ATF on July 8, 2013, by which time he had sung like a canary and told them all about the deep web market he had got his gun from. Whilst its impossible to determine with precision exactly when the warrant (rather than controlled delivery) happened, it must have been between 28 June and 8 July, 2013. Sidebar – at least a 7 day hold on an EMS package, one might infer, is enough to have alarm bells ringing<br/>
    To finish off, here’s a gun controlled delivery, but we don’t have to draw any inferences or dig through multiple sources, Customs has laid it bare for us. <a href="http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/two-charged-for-importing-firearm-hidden-in-computer">Long story short, Customs spots gun hidden in computer on 16 August. Feds get involved. Controlled delivery occurs just over 2 weeks later on 2 September, 2013.</a></p>
    <p>So what have we learned today? The Aussies, in their infinite wisdom, give provide such precise operational details in their media releases as to allow detailed analyses such as these, essentially providing counterintelligence whilst trumpeting their success. I doubt I’m the only one reading through the <a href="http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/">extensive news release collection over at their site</a>, stunned by the sheer quantity of operational information they don’t mind sharing, More importantly, we’ve seen that a controlled delivery need not take more than a week if you’re a priority, but even if you are, could take more than two weeks, to get things ready. Could it be done faster? Perhaps. But now we’ve established some useful baseline examples.</p>
