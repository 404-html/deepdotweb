    <p>FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler recently announced a <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0310/DOC-338159A1.pdf">proposal</a> to “give broadband consumers increased choice, transparency &amp; security with respect to their data”.</p>
    <p>“The information collected by the phone company about your telephone usage has long been protected information. Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limit your phone company&#8217;s ability to repurpose and resell what it learns about your phone activity.”, wrote Wheeler in an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-your-data-protect-online-privacy_b_9428484.html">op-ed</a> for The Huffington Post. “The same should be true for information collected by your ISP.”</p>
    <p>Under Wheeler&#8217;s proposal, ISPs would only be allowed to use customer data for “the purposes of marketing other communications-related services and to share customer data with their affiliates that provide communications-related services for the purposes of marketing such services unless the customer affirmatively opts out.”</p>
    <p>To do anything else with customer data, the ISP must have the customer affirmatively opt-in.</p>
    <p>The proposal adds in that ISPs do not require the customer&#8217;s consent to use their data to provide the service that the customer purchased because consent is inherent in the customer&#8217;s decision to purchase the ISP&#8217;s services.</p>
    <p>“&#8230; customer data necessary to provide broadband services and for marketing the type of broadband service purchased by a customer would require no additional customer consent beyond the creation of the customer-broadband provider relationship.”</p>
    <p>Wheeler also wants ISPs to keep customer&#8217;s data secure and implement measures to safeguard it. At the very least, ISPs would be required to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Adopt risk management practices</li>
    <li>Institute personnel training practices</li>
    <li>Adopt strong customer authentication requirements</li>
    <li>Identify a senior manager responsible for data security</li>
    <li>Take responsibility for use and protection of customer information when shared with third parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event of a data breach, ISPs would be required to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Notify affected customers of breaches of their data no later than 10 days after discovery</li>
    <li>Notify the FCC of any breach of customer data no later than 7 days after discovery</li>
    <li>Notify the FBI and the US Secret Service of breaches affecting more than 5,000 customers no later than 7 days after discovery of breach</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The proposal makes sure to point out that “it’s about permission and protection, not prohibition”, it explains that ISPs won&#8217;t be prohibited from using or sharing customer data, for any reason. It simply wants customers to have a say in what happens to their data. They do this by either opting out or requiring their ISP to get their permission before doing anything.</p>
    <p>For those of you wondering, this doesn&#8217;t mean that ISPs won&#8217;t hand over your data to law enforcement. Not only is that out of this proposal&#8217;s scope, so is the what other sites like Twitter or Facebook do with your data, along with other services your ISP may provide such as web hosting.</p>
    <p>Wheeler concluded his op-ed with:</p>
    <p>“Simply by using the Internet, you have no choice but to share large amounts of personal information with your broadband provider. You have a right to know what information is being collected about you and how that information is being used. That&#8217;s why establishing baseline privacy standards for ISPs is a common sense idea whose time has come. The bottom line is that it&#8217;s your data. How it&#8217;s used and shared should be your choice.”</p>
    <p>The FCC is set to vote on this proposal on March 31.</p>
