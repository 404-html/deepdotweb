    <p class="Standard">Earlier this month on March 11, a <a href="https://media.scmagazine.com/documents/220/brian_farrell_54789.pdf"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">plea</span></a> was entered into the District Court for the Western District of Washington where Brian Farrell admitted to being DoctorClu, one of the “key players” in Silk Road 2.0.</p>
    <p class="Standard">With this admission, Farrell pleaded guilty to Conspiracy To Distribute Heroin, Methamphetamine, and Cocaine. He was charged with this because of his position on Silk Road 2.0 which facilitated drug trade and the fact that he maintained the market. The penalty for this offense could have landed him in prison for up to 40 years with a fine up to $5,000,000 USD and supervision for 4 years after release from prison along with a special assessment of $100 USD. However, Farrell accepted a plea agreement which will recommend an 8 year sentencing, but nothing is guaranteed. He also agreed to pay the special assessment on or before the time of sentencing.</p>
    <p class="Standard">“The parties each agree to recommend a sentence of eights of imprisonment. The parties are otherwise free to recommend any other terms of the sentence, including the length and terms of supervised release. Defendant understands that the Court is not bound by the parties&#8217; recommendations.”</p>
    <p class="Standard">According to the plea agreement, Farrell began using Silk Road 2.0 to purchase drugs for personal usage, and over time he became a staff member under the alias “DoctorClu” where he was considered a spokesman for the head administrator, “Defcon”. Moreover, at one point he lead a DDOS attack against Tor Market, a competitor to Silk Road 2.0.</p>
    <p class="Standard">“After joining the site, Farrell lead a “denial-of-service-attack” on the Tor Market, a competitor to SR2.”</p>
    <p class="Standard">Farrell will also forfeit any property related to the charge he plead guilty to, which means his $35,000 USD and multiple silver bullion bars will be forfeited, both of which were seized on January 2 – when his residence was raided.</p>
    <p class="Standard">The downfall of Silk Road 2.0 was partly because of Carnegie Mellon University&#8217;s <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/02/28/court-documents-confirm-cmu-paid-by-government-in-tor-attacks/"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">attacks</span></a> on Tor.</p>
    <p class="Standard"><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/silk-road-20-right-hand-man-pleads-guilty"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Motherboard</span></a> reports that Farrell&#8217;s sentencing will take place on June 3.</p>
