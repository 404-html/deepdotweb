    <p><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/shocked-judge-says-it-seems-as-if-child-pornographer-matthew-graham-is-from-another-planet-20160218-gmxhwh.html">County Court Judge Michael Tinney expressed his deep shock at the crimes of Matthew David Graham (23), a hurtcore child porn website administrator known as Lux, during the man’s hearing.</a> Judge Tinney said about the 23-year-old:</p>
    <p>&#8220;It is as if he is from another planet.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Judge Tinney told David Gibson, representing Graham’s defense, that the lawyer had &#8220;already conceded the inevitability of a substantial term of imprisonment [for his client] &#8211; the issue for me is just how substantial.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Graham, living in South Morang with his parents before, was the administrator of a network of hurtcore child porn websites on the dark web. He ran the sites between the time frame of 2011 and 2014. He began his illegal activity at the age of 18 when he was a VCE student at Epping Secondary College in the northern suburbs. He was arrested in 2014 after a joint FBI and Victoria Police operation.</p>
    <p>Graham was closely linked to Peter Scully, the Australian paedophile who is now facing murder, rape and human trafficking charges in the Philippines. Scully made a four-part video called Daisy&#8217;s Destruction where he and his Filipino girlfriend allegedly sexually tortured an 18-month-old girl. Graham admitted that he used this video serie to advertise his child porn website.</p>
    <p>Graham was also involved with another Melbourne man who filmed himself abusing a young female relative.</p>
    <p>Judge Tinney watched the videos from Graham’s case earlier.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I am very much into uncharted territory,&#8221; Judge Tinney told court.</p>
    <p>Referring to Daisy’s Destruction the judge said:</p>
    <p>&#8220;How any human can view that impassively &#8230; the infant was being tortured, actual physical torture, an extremely trusting, vulnerable child who begins smiling wearing a nappy and ends a wailing physical wreck. I have seen some shocking things over the journey of my career and I have never seen anything like that.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Graham will be sentenced by Judge Tinney on March 17.</p>
