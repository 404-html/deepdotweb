    <p><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/judge-rules-fbi-must-reveal-malware-used-to-hack-over-1000-computers-playpen-jay-michaud">A judge ruled that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has to provide every detail of their operation on the dark web that resulted in the hacking of around 1,000 computers.</a> When asked, Colin Fieman, a federal public defender, said that the report will also include the malware used in the attack. His official statement goes by:</p>
    <p>“The declaration from our code expert was quite specific and comprehensive, and the order encompasses everything he identified.”</p>
    <p>Fieman is defending Jay Michaud, a former Vancouver worker who was arrested for possessing child porn material. The man was busted in the same operation by the FBI where the agency seized PlayPen, a child porn website, and used as a bait for catching users. The bureau used an NIT (network investigative technology) to acquire the IP address, Mac address and other technical details of the hidden service users.</p>
    <p>The case has caught the attention of several civil liberties activists since the three-letter-agency used only one warrant for acquiring private information of unknown suspects from all over the world. Also, the FBI by using NIT on PlayPen, has literally distributed child porn.</p>
    <p>According to official court documents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation harvested around 1,300 IP addresses and about 137 people have been charged so far.</p>
    <p>The code of NITs has already been revealed to the public in the past. In Operation Torpedo, a similar case in 2012, the government provided details of its technique, which turned out to be a novel use of popular hacking-toolkit called Metasploit. The FBI used a Flash applet to make a direct connection to the internet, instead of routing the targets’ traffic through Tor.</p>
    <p>“The order yesterday requires disclosure of all the code components,” Fieman told the media.</p>
    <p>Peter Carr, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, made this statement:</p>
    <p>“The court has granted the defense&#8217;s third motion to compel, subject to the terms of the protective order currently in place.</p>
