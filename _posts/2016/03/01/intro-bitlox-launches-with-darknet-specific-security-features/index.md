Encased in titanium and aerospace grade alloys, and with never-before-seen privacy and security features including hidden Bitcoin wallet support, duress PIN, AEM, quad password protection, and more. </em></p>
    <p><em>With the new BitLox™, you can be sure that your Bitcoin transactions are never subjected to scrutiny. </em></p>
    <p><em>The twin pillars of this system are <strong>SECURITY</strong> and <strong>PRIVACY</strong> &#8211; provided by the BitLox™ and our TOR-based web wallet app.</em></p>
    <p>With a sleek shockproof and weatherproof metal case the size of a credit card, measuring only 4 mm in thickness and a weight of only 25g, <a href="https://www.bitlox.com/">BitLox hardware Bitcoin wallets</a> pack a punch. BitLox wallets feature a 2&#8243; full matrix advanced e-paper display, multiple layers of PIN protection and Bluetooth LE for access on the go with your smartphone.<a href="https://www.bitlox.com/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13356" src="/imgs/2016/03/1.jpg" alt="1" width="591" height="394" srcset="/imgs/2016/03/1.jpg 7360w, /imgs/2016/03/1-300x200.jpg 300w, /imgs/2016/03/1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px"/></a></p>
    <p>BitLox&#8217;s hardware Bitcoin wallets include a range of unprecedented features for ironclad Bitcoin security and privacy of users, with multiple wallets (each with its own encrypted seed) and numerous security features.</p>
    <p><strong>Using the Darknet with Tor, I2P and TailsOS Access, Without Compromising Security:</strong></p>
    <p>Only BitLox has the ability to use the security of the ultimate hardware Bitcoin wallet combined with the absolute privacy of Darknet access tools. Hardware wallets can be used with BitLox&#8217;s <strong>TOR based access</strong> (<a href="http://www.bitlox2twvzwbzpk.onion/"><u>http://www.bitlox2twvzwbzpk.onion</u>/</a>), or even the newest privacy network <strong>I2P</strong> (<a href="http://www.bitlox.i2p/"><u>http://www.bitlox.i2p/</u></a>).</p>
    <p>Astonishingly the BitLox can also be used with the epitome of anonymous networking &#8211; the TailsOS &#8211; where every boot and use is as with a clean computer.</p>
    <p><strong>Hidden Bitcoin Wallets No One Else Can Access, or Prove They Even Exist:</strong></p>
    <p>BitLox is proud to present <em>hidden Bitcoin wallets</em>. Users can keep an extra stash of funds in special wallets that are <em>indistinguishable from random data</em>. It is impossible to prove that these wallets even exist. <strong>This gives you perfect plausible deniability.</strong></p>
    <p>Our HIDDEN WALLETS are a must-have feature &#8211; only YOU even know they are there. When using a hidden wallet, your wallet data is fully encrypted and written onto a field of random data &#8211; no one can even prove it exists! This coupled with the ultra-strong PINs made possible with the BitLox make for total secrecy and plausible deniability when it comes to storing your funds.</p>
    <p>BitLox recommends placing a small amount of BTC in an open wallet, with the bulk of remaining funds hidden. In the unlikely case of extortion or coercion, one could even reluctantly give up one hidden wallet. But that&#8217;s OK, because the BitLox supports up to 50 hidden Bitcoin wallets for unprecedented privacy and security of users.</p>

    <p><strong>Duress PIN for self-destruct: </strong></p>
    <p>If there ever is a need to quickly return the BitLox to the factory fresh state, the <em>duress PIN</em> can be used in place of the normal device PIN to <strong>instantly</strong> and <strong>irrevocably</strong> wipe the BitLox memory rendering it factory fresh with no trace of the previous contents.</p>
    <p><strong>Anti Evil Maid, Available Only on BitLox: </strong></p>
    <p>AEM, or Anti Evil Maid, is a system where users set a special recognition phrase so they can always verify that it is <em>their</em> BitLox, instead of a device substituted by some evil actor intent on finding out the device PINs.</p>
    <p><strong>Quad Passwords For Layered PIN Protection:</strong></p>
    <p>Every BitLox has multiple layers of PIN protection:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>A PIN to activate the BitLox itself.</strong> Until this PIN is entered, the BitLox has no communication with the outside world. None. All USB and Bluetooth circuits are disabled until the correct device PIN has been entered. Brute-force PIN breaking attacks are countered by an exponential security delay that is evaluated BEFORE the PIN is.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2">
    <li><strong>Every wallet has it&#8217;s own PIN</strong>, including our best feature HIDDEN WALLETS.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3">
    <li><strong>An additional TRANSACTION PIN</strong> may be set, so that each and every transaction must be authorized for an open wallet, so that even if somehow you were attacked in the middle of using your BitLox, the adversaries STILL couldn&#8217;t transfer your funds. An incorrect transaction PIN forces an immediate reset and 45 minute lockout.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="4">
    <li><strong>Device verification PIN</strong> &#8211; also known as Anti Evil Maid Protection &#8211; helps you make sure that your BitLox has not been surreptitiously substituted with a fake that attempts to steal your PINs and transmit them elsewhere.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>ALL</strong> BitLox <strong>PINs</strong> may be up to <em>20 characters in length</em>, alphanumeric, such as 72DmlghIE56oL93ChDTT &#8211; enormously increasing the security of any PIN you set.</p>
    <p>ALL of the PIN input is done exclusively on the BitLox itself using the built-in alphanumeric keypad &#8211; no worrying about possibly compromised computers sniffing your entries.</p>
    <p>These security features are then coupled with our <em>DARKNET ACCESS TOOLS</em> &#8211; You can use the BitLox via our .onion web wallet on any Tor-enabled system, or for the ultimate in anonymity, our tools are even compatible with TailsOS.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13357" src="/imgs/2016/03/2.jpg" alt="2" width="662" height="386" srcset="/imgs/2016/03/2.jpg 5358w, /imgs/2016/03/2-300x175.jpg 300w, /imgs/2016/03/2-1024x597.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px"/></p>
    <p>The <strong>BITLOX EXTREME PRIVACY SET</strong> brings all of this together, with a titanium-clad BitLox hardware wallet paired with a military-grade encrypted USB vault. This USB vault is specially modified to allow it to serve as a boot volume for TailsOS. In this manner, the fact that you are even using TailsOS is obscured. And of course, the USB vault also has a self-destruct PIN.</p>
    <p>With <strong>BitLox</strong>, you never have to worry about the <strong>safety</strong> and <strong>security</strong> of your funds or the <strong>anonymity</strong> of your transactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Every BitLox </strong><strong>carries a FIVE-YEAR warranty, and prices start at $199.</strong></p>
