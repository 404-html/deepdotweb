    <p>Megan Schadeberg (19), from Carmarthenshire, had <a href="http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Teenager-tried-buy-Glock-pistol-dark-web-books/story-28949305-detail/story.html">attempted to buy a Glock handgun</a> from the dark web and said she wanted to ”kill herself and kill the world&#8221; according to the court. During the house search, police found books on mass shootings where the girl made notes. They also found a diary where Schadeberg said that she &#8220;hated everyone&#8221; and &#8220;did not feeling anything for other people&#8221;.</p>
    <p>On the 19-year-old’s iPhone, the law enforcement authorities found the link of a dark net marketplace where Schadeberg put a Glock G21 and ammunition for it in a shopping basket and uploaded £240 in Bitcoins to a wallet, which she could use for a down payment for the weapon and the bullets.</p>
    <p>Schadeberg pleaded guilty to the attempt of buying a prohibited weapon in October last year when she appeared in the dock of Swansea Crown Court last week. According to official court documents, her plan to buy a gun came to light after she told a psychiatrist about it who then alerted police.</p>
    <p>The court also heard that Schadeberg was suffering from &#8220;some form of psychotic illness&#8221;. According to Craig Jones, from defense, the girl’s actions had been &#8220;a cry for help&#8221;.</p>
    <p>Judge Paul Thomas QC described the case as &#8220;terribly sad and also very worrying&#8221; and he made a hospital order detaining the teenager so she could be treated.</p>
