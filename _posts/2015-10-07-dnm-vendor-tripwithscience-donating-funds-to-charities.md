<p>Have you ever wondered if there are DNM dealers on the darknet who are donating money to charities? Honestly, I have never ever imagined such thing, however, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3ndeb7/drug_profits_donated_to_doctors_without_borders/">TripWithScience, a well-known vendor on DNMs has donated 4.392000 BTC (worth $973.50 at the moment when he has donated the funds) to the charity Doctors Without Borders.</a></p>
<p>It is a great act from TripWithScience, in addition to that, he has done the donation twice. <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/356kmu/psaarticle_dnm_profits_donated_to_nepal_relief/">He has donated 1 month’s earnings to the Red Cross to help the survivors of the Nepal earthquake in May 2015.</a> The amount the vendor was donating was 25 BTC ($5,848 at the time of donation).</p>
<p>The first donation of TripWithScience was significantly more than the latter, however, the point is not how much do we give to charities, but the act itself. I personally think that if most people would be on the same point of view as TripWithScience, the world would be a much better place. No matter what you do and who you are, you can be a manager of a company, a gardener, a drug dealer or the president of the United States, the fact that you have donated funds to help people is enough.</p>
<p>A user on Reddit has asked TripWithScience about the reasons why he has donated 1 months of his earnings to charities 5 months ago. He responded with an honest answer: the vendor does increase both his and the darknet’s reputation with this act and, most importantly, he helps people by donating. It’s a win-win situation.</p>
<p>”Maybe other vendors are doing this quietly. But the Darknet gets such a bad rap – and I truly believe that we are a collection of (relatively) law-abiding citizens safely exploring the limits of our consciousness, and the nature of these darknet markets eliminates or drastically reduces the crime that most people associate with drug culture. We&#8217;re a net positive for society and the economy. And by being public about my donation I can at least give one thing for people to point a finger at and say: ”See? Not so bad, these guys.”</p>
<p>I make every effort to help my customers have an amazing and safe experience with my product. I heard one businessman say once “What motivates you in your business? 50% of your &#8216;reward&#8217; should be the money, but the other 50% should be testimonials. If you don&#8217;t believe your products help people then you should find a new business.” … and I took those words to heart. And have you seen those PSAs where they tell people “if you ever buy drugs, you are supporting TERRORISTS, because&#8230; er, reasons!” Well, I wanted people to know that this week if you buy from me, you are DIRECTLY helping those in dire need. And I think that most certainly would make my customers feel better and influence them towards a more fulfilling experience when they trip.” said TripWithScience in his response.</p>
<p>In his most recent donation (3 days ago), he stated about the same:</p>
<p>”Like last time, the reason I&#8217;m now being public about this donation is because I want the world to know that even though we&#8217;re a community of drug dealers and users, we aren&#8217;t hurting anyone by confining our (non-violent, victimless) criminal activities online. And in this instance, a percentage of the money some of you have spent on illegal drugs is going directly to help those in need.”</p>
<p>I think TripWithScience provides a great example for the whole DNM community with his acts, and maybe these kinds of acts are needed to save the reputation of the whole darknet.</p>
