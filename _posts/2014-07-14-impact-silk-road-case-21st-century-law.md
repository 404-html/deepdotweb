<p>Recorded at the Free State Project&#8217;s annual Porcupine Freedom Festival (PorcFest 2014) on June 27, 2014.</p>
<p>The Federal government claims Ross Ulbricht created and operated Silk Road under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts. He has pleaded not guilty on four counts: narcotics trafficking; computer hacking; money laundering; and engaging in a criminal enterprise. He faces up to 30 years in prison.</p>
<p>In support of her son, Lyn Ulbricht of Free Ross spoke at PorcFest about this amazing case, and how the outcome may set precedent, influence new law, impact our freedom, and affect our constitutional rights.</p>
